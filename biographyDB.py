'real name: Ahmad Jamal--Highly influential jazz pianist, born 2 July 1930 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as Freddy Fritz Jones. He has used the name Ahmad Jamal since his conversion to Islam in the early 1950s. ',\
'Al Foster':\
'real name: Aloysius Tyrone Foster--American jazz drummer, born January 18, 1943 in Richmond, Virginia, USA.\
\
A member of [a=Miles Davis]’ band for 13 years, he was one of the few people to have contact with Davis during his retirement from 1975–1981.\

'Al Haig':\
'real name: Allan Warren Haig--American jazz pianist and one of the pioneers of bebop.\
\
Born :  July 19, 1922 in Newark, New Jersey.\
\
Died :  November 16, 1982 in New York City, New York.  (Heart attack)\
\
Al started playing with [a=Dizzy Gillespie] and [a=Charlie Parker] in 1945 [2], and performed and recorded under Gillespie from 1945 to 1946, as a member of [a=Eddie Davis And His Beboppers] in 1946 (also featuring [a=Fats Navarro]), and [a=Eddie Davis And His Quintet] in 1947, under Parker from 1948 to 1950, and under [a=Stan Getz] from 1949 to 1951. The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for [l=Guild Records] in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the celebrated nonet on the first session of [a=Miles Davis]\' Birth of the Cool. Although Haig became known for his distinctive and pioneering bebop style, he in fact spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.\
\
In 1969 Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey on 9 October 1968. He had said in evidence that his wife had been drunk, and had died in a fall down a flight of stairs. Grange Rutan, Haig\'s second wife, challenged Haig\'s account in her 2007 book, Death of a Bebop Wife. Rutan\'s book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie\'s story in detail, describing an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan notes that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig\'s violent personality that went unheeded. Importantly, she quotes bassist [a=Harold Gaylor], who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie\'s death.\
\
In 1974 Haig was invited to tour Europe by [a=Tony Williams (13)], owner of [l=Spotlite Records] in the UK. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the \'Invitation\' album for Spotlite, with [a=Gilbert Rovère], on bass and [a=Kenny Clarke] on drums. This kick-started his re-emergence and over the next eight years he built a strong following in Europe and toured several times, recording in the UK and France, and appearing elsewhere. He recorded for several Japanese labels',\

'Art Blakey':\
'real name: Arthur Blakey (Abdullah Ibn Buhaina)--Art Blakey (born October 11, 1919, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA - died October 16, 1990, New York City, New York, USA) \
\
was an American jazz drummer, composer and bandleader, best remembered as founder and 35 year leader of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/262128-Art-Blakey-The-Jazz-Messengers]\
\
Blakey was the foster son in a Seventh Day Adventist Family, learning the piano as he learned the Bible, mastering both at an early age. In the early 1930\'s, while gigging at the Democratic Club in Pittsburgh, Arts\' piano career came to an abrupt end when he was ordered onto the drums to make way for pianist [a=Erroll Garner]. This incident was apparently at the gunpoint of the nightclubs\' owner, as Blakey later on often recalled. This served as good fortune and young drummer Blakey came under the tutelage of legendary drummer and bandleader [a=Chick Webb], serving as his valet.  Returning to Pittsburgh in 1937, he formed his own band, backing pianist [a=Mary Lou Williams].  in 1939, he joined and toured with [a=Fletcher Henderson] for 3 years, followed by one year gigging at Bostons\' Tic Toc club. Then as a member of [a=Billy Eckstine]\'s band, he played with the likes of [a=Charlie Parker], [a=Dizzy Gillespie] and [a=Sarah Vaughan]. When Eckstein disbanded his group in 1947, Blakey organized the Seventeen Messengers, a rehearsal band and recorded with an octet called the Jazz Messengers, the first of his many groups bearing this name. In 1948, he visited Africa where he learned polyrhythmic drumming and was introduced to Islam, taking the name Abdullah Ibn Buhaina.\
\
The early 1950\'s, saw him performing and broadcasting with such musicians as [a=Miles Davis], [a=Clifford Brown], and [a=Horace Silver]. Blakey and Silver connected and formed the [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/262128-Art-Blakey-The-Jazz-Messengers]Jazz Messengers[/url]. This band soon evolved into [a262128] with Blakey remaining the leader with changing personnel, playing together with them until his death. From 1947 until 1972 he also recorded regularly with [a=Thelonious Monk].\
\
Blakey was a major figure in modern jazz and an important stylist in drums. His contribution to jazz as a discoverer and molder of young talent over three decades cannot be overlooked.',\
'Artie Shaw':\
'real name: Avraham Ben-Yitzhak Arshawsky --Artie Shaw (born May 23, 1910, New York City, New York, USA - died December 30, 2004, Thousand Oaks, California, USA) was an American clarinetist and bandleader.\
\
His first public appearance leading his own band was in his native New York City on the 24th of May, 1936 and he became one of the biggest names in jazz and popular music during the late 1930\'s and 1940\'s swing heyday. He last toured as a performing clarinetist with a big band in 1950, and made his last live / public performing appearances with a small group in 1954. Shaw made his last records of new material (on which he was merely conducting and not playing) in 1955.  He spent much of the second half of his life devoted to writing and other pursuits, although he returned to the recording studios in 1968 to conduct an album of some of his biggest instrumental hits (from 1938-39) with a band that was filled by other notable veteran sidemen of the Swing Era, some of whom had worked for him three decades earlier and were at the time still working professional musicians in their prime. In 1983 he surprised the music world once again by assembling a 16-piece touring big band under the direction of clarinetist Dick Johnson and Shaw appeared with it through 1986-87, at which time he turned the band over to Johnson once and for all. The anti-nostalgic Shaw explicitly stated that he wanted this last band to focus on jazz and lesser known later works from 1944-45 and especially 1949, as well as new material written for the band, much of which was never recorded. He was married eight times including to [a2860190] (1940) and [a1481869] (1945-46).',\

'Charlie Christian':\
'real name: Charles Henry Christian--b. Bonham, Texas, July 29th, 1916; d. Seaview Hospital, Staten Island NY, March 2nd 1942.\
\
Guitar player - one of the 3 or 4 most highly rated in jazz history.\
\
Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 (Early Influence). \
\
Career began with occasional gigs as a bass player in various combos around Oklahoma in the early days of the Depression. He spent more than a year with pianist Alphonso Trent\'s sextet, which played in Casper, Wyoming, and Deadwood, South Dakota. Early inspiration for Christian came from [a=Lester Young], who came to town with [a=Walter Page]\'s Blue Devils to play the season at the Ritz Ballroom in 1931. The Ritz was a white ballroom, and the black players had to be content to do their jamming after hours in Slaughter\'s Hall on East 2nd Street - or Deep Second as it was called. Here Christian and his brothers, Hot Lips Page, Lem Johnson, Eddie Durham, Harry Smith, Hobart Banks, Little Dog, James Simpson and other early players gathered to trade ideas and try to top one another, developing on their chosen instruments.\
\
During this period Christian learned from a variety of guitar players with whom he came into contact: Tommy Lee House, Charlie Faris, Claude Burns and Ralph Chuck Hamilton. Perhaps his biggest influence at this point was James Jim Daddy Walker, one of the stars of Clarence Love\'s orchestra from Kansas City. Love played Oklahoma City many times from 1933 onwards, and in their first encounters, Walker (4 years Christian\'s senior) gave him many a lesson in guitar mastery. Other ideas came from [a=Eddie Durham], who Christian heard a year or so later featuring with Jimmie Lunceford\'s band, and playing a guitar with a resonator. By the time Walker and Christian met again in 1936, however, Christian had developed enormously and was well able to handle the older player.\
\
Christian left Oklahoma City in 1939 at the age of 23, on the promptings of Mary Lou Williams and John Hammond, and soon joined [a=Benny Goodman]\'s band. Over the next 3 years he would tour across the US with Goodman, and achieve huge popularity. Recordings - both live broadcasts and in the studio (for Columbia and others) also followed. He won the Down Beat Poll for Best Jazz Guitarist in 1939, \'40 and \'41, and equivalent Metronome polls in 1940 and \'41. \
\
In June 1941 Christian\'s health failed and he was quickly admitted to first Bellevue, then Seaview hospital in NY. He was never able to recover from the tuberculosis, and died 9 months later.\

'real name: Elvin Ray Jones--Elvin Jones was born September 9, 1927 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA.\
\
Died on May 18, 2004, Englewood, New Jersey, USA, from heart failure.\
\
Called by Life magazine the world\'s greatest rhythmic drummer. He had two musician brothers:  [a=Hank Jones], a jazz pianist, and [a=Thad Jones], a trumpet and flugelhorn player. Jones entered the Detroit jazz scene in the late 1940s after touring as a stagehand with the Army Special Services show Operation Happiness. After a brief gig at the Detroit club Grand River Street, he went to work at another club, backing up such jazz greats as Parker, Davis and Wardell Grey. Jones, with his rhythmic, innovative style, became one of jazz\'s most famous drummers under Coltrane. \
\
By age 13, determined to be a drummer, Elvin was practicing eight to ten hours a day. In 1946 Elvin enlisted in the Army, and toured with a Special Services show called Operation Happiness - as a stagehand. Unofficially, however, he was honing his own musical skills and gaining confidence, playing at post social affairs. Jones was discharged in 1949, returning to a Detroit musical scene that was as vibrant as any outside New York. Elvin began to frequent the Bluebird Inn. In time, Jeader Billy Mitchell hired Elvin, and in three years at the club he backed up visiting stars including the legendary Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, Wardell Grey, and, for six months, Miles Davis. In Addition, Monday nights there were jam sessions Elvin organized at his home. The long list of musicians Elvin played with during this period includes Miles Davis, Sonny Stitt, Tommy Flanagan, Pepper Adams, Barry Harris, Kenny Burrell, Milt Jackson, Lou Hayes and Yusef Lateef. Elvin made his move to New York ostensibly to audition for a new Benny Goodman band. Instead, he ended up with Charles Mingus, and in subsequent years he developed his style with Bud Powell, Miles Davis, the Pepper Adams-Donald Byrd Quintet, Art Farmer and J.J. Johnson. He also had his first experiences playing with Miles\' tenor man and the increasingly celebrated recording artist John Coltrane. After leaving Miles in 1960, Coltrane was touring in San Francisco with his new group when he flew back to New York to seek out Elvin. Through 1966, Elvin contributed to some of the most controversial, influential, and ultimately important music in jazz. Among the triumphant recordings from his great association are A love Supreme and Coltrane \'Live\' at the Village Vanguard. In March 1966, Elvin left Coltrane. After a brief European tour with Duke Ellington\'s band he returned to New York to begin his distinguished career as leader, with a series of innovative piano-less trios featuring Joe Farrell on tenor alto and flute, and one of several bassists including Jimmy Garrison, Bill Wood, Charlie Haden and Wilbur Little. Elvin has been heard on nearly 500 recordings, with no end in sight. He also made a temporary detour to Hollywood in 1971 to appear as the character Job Cain in the ABC Paramount film Zachariah. Reflecting his deep commitment to the music Playing is not something I do at night he said, It\'s my function in life.\

Then the Jerry Hahn Brotherhood was initiated by him in 1970. This formation has been described as one of the “trailblazers of rock-jazz integration”. Later he joined the Bennie Wallace Quartet and he also performed, toured, and recorded with former Cream drummer Ginger Baker. Hahn has a Doctor of Music degree and has taught at several universities. He continues to perform, record, tour, and conduct guitar clinics. Hahn has also written columns for the Guitar Player magazine and a textbook for jazz guitar.\

\
Although active as a player from the age of 14, it wasn\'t until the 1960s – following a long battle with, and eventual rehabilitation from drug addiction – that he began to establish himself as one of the very great jazz guitarists.  A brilliant improviser, his early small group recordings featured fluent, bop-influenced, single note lines, coupled with a sophisticated harmonic sense and tremendous rhythmic drive and invention.  In the 1970s he recorded the first of several solo performances in which he adopted a fingerstyle approach to playing rather than using a plectrum.  As well as leading his own groups, he recorded with many of the great names of jazz, including Count Basie, Benny Carter, Zoot Sims, Milt Jackson, Duke Ellington and, notably, four classic albums with Ella Fitzgerald.  The Ibanez company produced a \'Joe Pass\' edition in their archtop jazz guitar range, and some years later, the Epiphone company manufactured a \'Joe Pass\' version of their \'Emperor\' jazz guitar.

\
John Coltrane was one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century. His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\
\
He recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous Special Citation from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his \'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz\'.\
\
As his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\

'John McLaughlin':\
'real name: John Rickard McLaughlin--British guitarist, songwriter, and artist. (not to be confused with the British pop songwriter [a=John McLaughlin (2)].) \
\
Born: 4 January 1942 in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, England, UK. \
\
A household name since the early 1970s, John McLaughlin was a fusion guitarist when he led the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra]. He started on guitar when he was 11 and was initially inspired by blues and swing players. He worked with [a=David Bowie], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Graham Bond], [a=Ginger Baker], and many others in the 1960s, and played free jazz with [a=Gunter Hampel] for six months. His first album was a classic, [m=75355] (1969), and was followed by an obscurity for the [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url] label with [a=John Surman], a quintet set with [a=Larry Young] on album [m=75603] (1970), and half acoustic solos and half jams involving Indian musicians on [m=75623] (1971). \
\
In 1969, McLaughlin moved to New York to play with [a=Tony Williams]\' [a=Lifetime] and he appeared on two classic [a=Miles Davis] records: [m=8408] (1969) and [m=8260] (1970). In 1971 McLaughlin formed the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra], a very powerful group often thought of as rock but having the sophisticated improvisations of jazz. After three influential albums – [m=72307] (1971), [m=72290] (1973), and [m=72279] (1973) – the group disbanded in late 1973. \
\
McLaughlin, who recorded a powerful spiritual album with [a=Carlos Santana] that was influenced by [a=John Coltrane], put together a new Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1974 that, despite the inclusion of [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], failed to catch on and broke up by 1975. McLaughlin then surprised the music world by radically shifting directions, switching to acoustic guitar and playing Indian music with his group Shakti. They made a strong impact on the nascent world music scene during their three years. McLaughlin then went back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars; leading [a=The One Truth Band]; playing in trios with [a=Al DiMeola] and [a=Paco De Lucia]; popping up on some mid-1980s [a=Miles Davis] records; forming a short-lived third version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra with saxophonist [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/503619-Bill-Evans-3]Bill Evans[/url]; recording an introspective tribute to pianist [a=Bill Evans]; and in 1993, touring with a rollicking jazz trio featuring [a=Joey DeFrancesco] and drummer [a=Dennis Chambers]. \
\
Throughout his productive career McLaughlin has recorded as a leader across labels, including [l=Marmalade], [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url], [l=Douglas], [l=CBS], [l=Warner Brothers], and [l=Verve]. \

'real name: Mary Elfreda Winn--Born: 8 May 1910, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\
\
Died: 28 May 1981, Durham, North Carolina, USA\
\
Black American jazz pianist, composer and arranger who performed with almost every major jazz artist throughout her career and renowned for her approach to the \'bop\' style.\
\
Williams grew up in a \'shotgun shack\', where local musicians would gather and play. She played piano by ear from a very early age, so small she sat on musician\'s laps to reach the keys. By the time she and her elder sister Mamie had moved to Pittsburgh she had a stepfather, professional gambler Fletcher Burley. He would take her into gambling joints, where she would play and get tips, whilst her boogie piano skills also came in useful at rent-parties and chitterlin\' struts.\
\
Still in her pre-teens she was impressed by the likes of female pianists [a634888] and [a307316] and the works of [a257353], [a309976] and, especially, Jack Howard. Even at this age she was \'toughening up\' to the realities of performing live ghetto music between East Liberty, Soho and the downtown districts of Pittsburgh.\
\
By the time Williams was in high school she had her big break. Her mother agreed, with the Theatre Owners\' Booking Association [TOBA], for her to tour with the \'Hits & Bits\' show for two months. Williams later referred to the acronym as \'Tough On Black Artists\'. It was a tour that enabled Williams to meet Earl Hines, [a1802929], [a309984], [a38201] and the blues singer, [a634503], in Chicago.\
\
In Cleveland she met [a731706] with his Syncopaters. \'Bearcat\', as he was known, impressed her and he would later become her husband. Back at school she began to learn more instruments, but decided to stick to the piano. After graduation she joined up with Williams on another TOBA tour and finally ended up in New York. Here she met [a253482] and got an intermission residence at Connie\'s Inn. Williams then went and got married in Memphis, where the two set up a new band, playing out of the Pink Rose Ballroom. Her husband then went to Oklahoma on an engagement, leaving seventeen year-old Mary Lou as leader of the band. She then joined up with her husband in Oklahoma, in the band that would become [a335595].\
\
Williams\' career then took another turn in Kansas City, playing all the speak-easy clubs during the prohibition years. In 1930 Williams cut her first solo recordings Drag \'Em and Night Life - for which she later barred sales, as she was never paid, although the producer had at least given her the new credit, by which she became known, Mary Lou. She then played with Kirk\'s band at the Pearl Theater in Philadelphia, backing [a888440]\'s act, followed by stints at Winnwood Beach Park Ballroom, the Sunset and Fairyland Park Ballroom in Kansas City. In Kansas she was also influenced by meeting [a265634], [a251783], [a145256] and female pianists [a317861], Oceola and \'Countess\' [a326846]. [a313012]\'s hot vocals were added to the band and [a257115] quit to join [a253474], around the same time that [a145262] was gaining attention at Kansas City\'s Reno Club. In this fertile atmosphere of swing Williams was composing and arranging furiously, penning numbers such as Froggy Bottom, Steppin\' Pretty, Corky, Walkin\' And Swingin\' and the popular Cloudy.\
\
In 1936 she recorded Isabelle and Overhand with Decca and was on nightly broadcasts from Cleveland, along with Pha Terrell and [a313076]. The band\'s release of Froggy Bottom became a big juke-hit and Williams toured with Kirk and the band through all the Southern states. By 1938 she had written vast quantities of arrangements for all the big names in jazz, sometimes credited, sometimes not. After a six-month engagement with yet another band line-up at the Grand Terrace in Chicago, that included [a843791] and [a322294], Williams was hospitalized with exhaustion and convalesced back in Pittsburgh. She rejoined the band for their residency at The Cotton Club in New York and, by the end of the club itself in 1941, her career took a down-turn. John Williams had departed her to start a catering business with Kirk\'s wife Mary, their musician Dick Wilson died and Mary Lou left the Andy Kirk band to return, once again, to Pittsburgh. Here she formed a combo with [a309982] that included [a29977] and Orlando Wright. However, Baker was soon poached by [a145257] and, by the time Williams\' band reached New York, she realised how much she missed him. She and Baker got hitched in Baltimore and so Williams\' piano occasionally became part of Ellington\'s ensemble. She left the band in Canada and went back to New York to join in the sessions at Minton\'s Playhouse on West 118th Street - the \'house that built bop\'. Here she jammed with Monk and the likes of [a312997], [a228917] and [a264620] until 1943, when an offer came to play solo in shows at the Café Society. Through this period of \'the bop\' she interpolated ideas with friends like Thelonius Monk, Tadd Dameron, [a258464], [a254945], [a29992] and Aaron Bridges. \
\
Williams had firm ideas about \'the real bop\' as she explained in \'Melody Maker\' in 1954; Often you hear guys blowing a lot of notes and people say: `They\'re bopping.\' But they are not. Bop is the phrasing and accenting of the notes, as well as the harmonies used. Every other note is accented. Never in the history of jazz has the phrasing been like it is in bop. Musicians like [a37737] come up with different styles which may be interesting. But they are not bop... That\'s one reason I tried to encourage the original modernists to continue writing and experimenting... Jazz is created in the mind, felt in the heart and heard through the fingertips.\

During 1944 Williams took time out and was recorded by \'Moe\' [a688836], who gained her royalty rights for works and also captured her Zodiac Suite, helping her to gain the recognition and financial freedom she deserved. She also met up with David Stone Martin and photographer Gjon Mili, the former designing her sleeves and the latter eventually displaying her portraits in New York\'s Museum Of Modern Art. \
\
After playing in both Café Society and Uptown Café on 59th Street for some five years her next break came when [a166628] hit town. Granz gained her recording dates with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, where her re-arranged \'Zodiac\' works were again captured to acetate. Williams then took time out again and then picked up, after doing some broadcasts and TV shows, to join [a254768] at Bop City on Broadway. In 1952 she then performed in the UK and toured Europe. Williams gave back much of what she had learned in her career, giving jazz masterclasses in American schools and on campus in her later years. Her final recording, three years before her death from bladder cancer, was Solo Recital - a medley of spirituals, ragtime, blues and swing - recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1978. She was interred at Calvary Cemetery in her hometown of Pittsburgh.  \

'Mose Allison':\
'real name: Mose John Allison, Jr.--Mose Allison (born November 11, 1927, Tippo, Mississippi, USA - died November 15, 2016, Hilton Head, South Carolina, USA) was an American jazz blues pianist and singer.\
\
He was born outside Tippo, Mississippi on his grandfather\'s farm, which was known as The Island because Tippo Bayou encircles it. He took piano lessons from age five, picked cotton, played piano in grammar school and trumpet in high school, and wrote his first song at age thirteen. He went to college at the University of Mississippi for a while, then enlisted in the U.S. Army for two years. Shortly after mustering out, he enrolled at Louisiana State University, from which he was graduated in 1952 with a BA in English with a minor in Philosophy.\
\
In 1956 he moved to New York City and launched his jazz career performing with artists such as [a30486], [a37733], [a261286], [a263796], and [a253777]. His debut album, Back Country Suite, was issued on the [l19591] label in 1957. He formed his own trio in 1958.\
\
It was not until 1963 that his record label allowed him to release an album entirely of vocals. Entitled Mose Allison Sings, it was a collection of songs that paid tribute to artists of the Mojo Triangle: [a287849] (Eyesight to the Blind), [a386791] (That\'s All Right) and [a166684] (The Seventh Son). However, it was an original composition in the album that brought him the most attention – Parchman Farm. For more than two decades, Parchman Farm was his most requested song. He dropped it from his playlist in the 1980\'s because some critics felt it was politically incorrect. Allison explained to [i]Nine-O-One Network Magazine[/i]: I don\'t do the cotton sack songs much anymore. You go to the Mississippi Delta and there are no cotton sacks. It\'s all machines and chemicals.\
\
His 1987 recorded album Ever Since The World Ended - Blue Note 48015  received the highest rating (5 starts) in Down Beat February 1988.\
\
Prestige Records tried to market Allison as a pop star, but [l1866] and later [l681] tried to market him as a blues artist. Because he sang blues, [i]Jet[/i] magazine thought that he was black and wanted to interview him.\
\
Allison was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006.\
\
Allison\'s March 2010 album, The Way of the World, marked his return to the recording studio after a 12-year absence.\
\
In 2012, Allison was honored with a blues marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in his hometown of Tippo. On January 14, 2013, Allison was honored as a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts at a ceremony at Lincoln Center in New York. The NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship is the nation\'s highest honor in jazz.\
\
Allison wrote some 150 songs. His own performances have been described as delivered in a casual conversational way with a melodic southern accented tone that has a pitch and range ideally suited to his idiosyncratic phrasing, laconic approach and ironic sense of humor.',\

\
Peterson went on many European tours. He has made recordings with just about everybody who\'s anybody in jazz. \
\
His keys touch corresponds to almost explosive ornamentation in phrasing. Despite all the dynamics, a boundless desire for improvisation, a sublime artistic technique, however, the structure of his play (i.e. the over-all conception of harmonic means, phrasing, rhythms, etc.) remains translucent and tight. \

American jazz vibraphone player & bandleader.\
\

'Thelonious Monk':\
'real name: Thelonious Sphere Monk--American jazz pianist and composer. \
\
Born: 10 October 1917 in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, USA. \
\
Died: 17 February 1982 in Weehawken, New Jersey, USA (aged 64). \
\
One of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century, Thelonious Monk had a idiosyncratic improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire. He is often regarded as one of the founders of bebop. Monk\'s prolific compositions and improvisations are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists.  His  unorthodox approach to the piano combines a highly percussive attack with abrupt, use of silence and dramatic pauses. He was also known for a distinct fashion sense in his suits, hats and trademark sunglasses. Monk was an unconventional stage presence, known for getting up from his piano to dance (sometimes in a counter-clockwise motion  which drew comparisons to ring-shout and Muslim Sufi whirling) while his band members were still playing. Monk is one of only five jazz musicians to date to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, which puts him in a select company with [a=Louis Armstrong], [a=Duke Ellington], [a=Wynton Marsalis], and [a=Dave Brubeck]. \

Particularly remembered as an accompanist of Ella Fitzgerald and player on [i] Giant Steps [/i] by John Coltrane. He played on a number of critically acclaimed recordings, such as Sonny Rollins\' [i] Saxophone Colossus, The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery [/i], and Art Pepper\'s [i] Straight Life [/i].\
\
Flanagan\'s style was both modest and exceptionally musical. He embodied many of the most important qualities associated with jazz: swing, harmonic sophistication, melodic invention, bluesy feel and humour. Interestingly, he appeared on a number of highly innovative albums. (His awkward solo, recorded on the extremely fast and harmonically complex title-track of Giant Steps, is an infamously rare instance of the usually unflappable pianist being caught off-guard.)\
\
During his career, Flanagan was nominated for four Grammy Awards — two for Best Jazz Performance (Group) and two for Best Jazz Performance (Soloist).',\
