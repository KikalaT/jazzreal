\
\
American jazz vibraphone player & bandleader.\
\
\
Got his professional start on drums with the Judy Kayne band. After three years in the U.S. Army he returned to immediate activity in and around New York and to a revitalized jazz scene that vibrated to the new music of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and other pioneers of the new era.\
\
After a brief term in with the Tommy Dorsey band, he toured Sweden with a group led by Chubby Jackson in December of 1947, then was featured with the Buddy Rich band until September the following year. When the Rich band folded, Gibbs joined Woody Herman\'s second Herd and won the international recognition that was so long overdue. During his year with Herman, Terry solidified a reputation for hard-swinging, unrelenting drive on vibes that enabled him to launch his own small groups in the years that followed. Since 1951 he has been one of the top jazz attractions in the U.S.\
\
\
In 1957 Gibbs settled in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Woodland Hills. He immediately laid plans for the realization of a long-held dream: to lead his own big band. \

\
\
In 1965 he met film producer Pier A. Caminneci in Berlin, for whom he did at least seven film scores.

'Charles Bateman':\
'real name: Charles Bateman--Jazz pianist. \
\
b. 1922 (Youngstown, OH)\
\
d. January 24, 2004. (Orlando, FL)\
\
\
Pianist Charles Bateman spent years training to play classical music, but his move into jazz took him into a world of which many of his fans could only dream. In his heyday, he could be found on stage with the likes of Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis.\
\
\
Bateman, who hit the Central Florida jazz scene after retiring and moving from New York City in the early 1990s, died Saturday (January 24, 2004). He was 82.\
\
\
\'I hate to say this, but it\'s true,\' said Anita Turner Bateman, his wife of 47 years. \'Charlie was a musical genius.\' \
\
\
Charles Bateman met Anita, a singer and actress, when the two were preparing for a gig in New York City. By then, he had already hit the big time. He and legendary trumpeter Armstrong were among a group of black jazz musicians who made a historic first appearance at Carnegie Hall in 1947.\
\
\
Born in Youngstown, Ohio, Bateman\'s familiarity with the piano came from a life steeped in music. His mother and father were pianists. She played gospel; he played the blues. They started Bateman\'s classical piano training at an early age. At 18, he performed as a soloist with the Buffalo Symphony Orchestra.\
\
\
Bateman moved to New York before his 20th birthday to study under renowned German pianist Bruno Eisner. He played jazz clubs on the side.\
\
\
He came to the Orlando area, not for jazz, but for a bridge tournament. He liked the warm weather and the area, Anita said. The couple built a house in Deltona but continued to live and work in New York.\
\
\
It was the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that persuaded him to make a permanent move. He had finished his regular gig in the Trade Center\'s Vista International Hotel and had gone home. The blast that claimed six lives occurred at 12:18 p.m. the next day. \
\
\
Damage from the bombing forced the hotel to close, so the Batemans decided it was the right time to move into their Volusia County home. Once there, he recorded three CDs and played regularly with other area musicians.\
\
\
Bateman was an Army veteran of World War II and earned a third-degree black belt in karate.\

\
\
His first public appearance leading his own band was in his native New York City on the 24th of May, 1936 and he became one of the biggest names in jazz and popular music during the late 1930\'s and 1940\'s swing heyday. He last toured as a performing clarinetist with a big band in 1950, and made his last live / public performing appearances with a small group in 1954. Shaw made his last records of new material (on which he was merely conducting and not playing) in 1955.  He spent much of the second half of his life devoted to writing and other pursuits, although he returned to the recording studios in 1968 to conduct an album of some of his biggest instrumental hits (from 1938-39) with a band that was filled by other notable veteran sidemen of the Swing Era, some of whom had worked for him three decades earlier and were at the time still working professional musicians in their prime. In 1983 he surprised the music world once again by assembling a 16-piece touring big band under the direction of clarinetist Dick Johnson and Shaw appeared with it through 1986-87, at which time he turned the band over to Johnson once and for all. The anti-nostalgic Shaw explicitly stated that he wanted this last band to focus on jazz and lesser known later works from 1944-45 and especially 1949, as well as new material written for the band, much of which was never recorded. He was married eight times including to [a2860190] (1940) and [a1481869] (1945-46).',

'La Monte Young':\
'real name: La Monte Thornton Young--La Monte Young is an American avant-garde artist, composer and musician, generally recognized as the first minimalist composer. His works are cited as notable examples of post-war avant-garde, experimental, and contemporary music. Young is especially known for his exploration of drone music. \
\
\
Born October 14, 1935 in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho, La Monte went to high school in Los Angeles. During this time he played saxophone in a group with Billy Higgins, [a=Dennis Budimir] and [a=Don Cherry] and with various other musicians.\
\
To continue his education, he relocated to Berkeley, where he met life long friend and collaborator [a=Terry Riley]. It was also in the Bay Area where he first encountered the work of [a=Angus MacLise], whose poetry he discovered at the City Light book shop. From here Young moved to New York City, where he has lived ever since.\
\
Upon his arrival in New York, he curated a series of concerts at Yoko Ono\'s loft and quickly became a legend in town. He studied electronic music with [a=Richard Maxfield] and became associated with many of the Fluxus artists, who took to performing his pieces in their concerts. With [a=Jackson Mac Low], he published An Anthology, which collected printed works by many of the radical artists of that time. Most importantly, La Monte started assembling an ensemble to play his music.\
\
The real breakthrough was when Young met [a=Marian Zazeela] who was to become his lifelong collaborator and partner. These two were joined by the young Welsh student [a=John Cale], mathematician [a=Tony Conrad], and percussionist and poet Angus MacLise. This core group became known at the Theater of Eternal Music and performed many groundbreaking concerts. This line up was not to last however, and over the decades many other musicians have come and gone in La Monte\'s ensemble.\
\
Going back to the late 1950\'s and extending to the present day, La Monte has focused his attention on pieces of extended duration, with minimal, often microtonal, change. For this reason, he is known as one of the father\'s of the minimal music \'movement\', though remains unique from his followers. In addition to this, Young and Zazeela were disciples of Pandit Pran Nath, and devoted a considerable amount of effort to the perservation and continuance of the Kirana style of Indian classic music.',

'real name: Joseph \'Joe\' Reisman--American Music Producer, Arranger, and Musician (born September 16, 1924 in Dallas - died September 15, 1987 in Los Angeles).\
\
\
Joe Reisman was one of the stalwart producers of space age pop, back in the days when the producer got all of the headaches and none of the glory. After studying music at Baylor University and the University of Texas at El Paso, Reisman got jobs playing sax with a variety of big bands, including Bob Crosby, Louis Prima, Jack Teagarden, and Glen Gray\'s Casa Loma Orchestra. By the late 1940s, he\'d decided it was time to give up playing and touring and settle for the security of arranging and producing.\
\
\
He hooked up with singer Patti Page just as she was hitting the big time, and he helped put together a string of hits, including \'Tennessee Waltz\' and \'How Much is That Doggy in the Window?\' He also started working in television and provided the music for a number of mid-1950s variety shows such as \'The Oldsmobile Hour\' and \'NBC\'s Shower of Stars.\' After Page, he teamed up with the Ames Brothers and eventually became a member of the staff of RCA Victor in Hollywood. While with RCA, he recorded several albums of light easy listening fare, and had a small hit with a cover of Ross Bagdasarian\'s tune, \'Armen\'s Theme.\'\
\
\
He moved from RCA to Roulette Records and became one of that label\'s leading producers, as well as continue to record occasionally himself. He was a classic example of the producer who took all the cares on his back, and acts ranging from Henry Mancini to the Grateful Dead have recalled him as being \'always worried.\' As Roulette\'s decline became evident in the early 1960s, Reisman took the opportunity to return to RCA. There he replaced Dick Peirce as Mancini\'s producer, and Reisman produced virtually all of Mancini\'s recordings from Our Man in Hollywood in 1964 on, for nearly 30 years.\
\
\
Well-respected in his industry, Reisman went on to produce nearly 1,000 recordings and helped create 14 million-selling singles and 8 gold albums. Nominated for the Grammy, he had been recognized by the Disney-sponsored California Institute of the Arts as well as the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS). \

\
Although active as a player from the age of 14, it wasn\'t until the 1960s – following a long battle with, and eventual rehabilitation from drug addiction – that he began to establish himself as one of the very great jazz guitarists.  A brilliant improviser, his early small group recordings featured fluent, bop-influenced, single note lines, coupled with a sophisticated harmonic sense and tremendous rhythmic drive and invention.  In the 1970s he recorded the first of several solo performances in which he adopted a fingerstyle approach to playing rather than using a plectrum.  As well as leading his own groups, he recorded with many of the great names of jazz, including Count Basie, Benny Carter, Zoot Sims, Milt Jackson, Duke Ellington and, notably, four classic albums with Ella Fitzgerald.  The Ibanez company produced a \'Joe Pass\' edition in their archtop jazz guitar range, and some years later, the Epiphone company manufactured a \'Joe Pass\' version of their \'Emperor\' jazz guitar.

'Art Blakey':\
'real name: Arthur Blakey (Abdullah Ibn Buhaina)--Art Blakey (born October 11, 1919, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA - died October 16, 1990, New York City, New York, USA) was an American jazz drummer, composer and bandleader, best remembered as founder and 35 year leader of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/262128-Art-Blakey-The-Jazz-Messengers]The Jazz Messengers[/url].\
\
\
Blakey was the foster son in a Seventh Day Adventist Family, learning the piano as he learned the Bible, mastering both at an early age. In the early 1930\'s, while gigging at the Democratic Club in Pittsburgh, Arts\' piano career came to an abrupt end when he was ordered onto the drums to make way for pianist [a=Erroll Garner]. This incident was apparently at the gunpoint of the nightclubs\' owner, as Blakey later on often recalled. This served as good fortune and young drummer Blakey came under the tutelage of legendary drummer and bandleader [a=Chick Webb], serving as his valet.  Returning to Pittsburgh in 1937, he formed his own band, backing pianist [a=Mary Lou Williams].  in 1939, he joined and toured with [a=Fletcher Henderson] for 3 years, followed by one year gigging at Bostons\' Tic Toc club. Then as a member of [a=Billy Eckstine]\'s band, he played with the likes of [a=Charlie Parker], [a=Dizzy Gillespie] and [a=Sarah Vaughan]. When Eckstein disbanded his group in 1947, Blakey organized the Seventeen Messengers, a rehearsal band and recorded with an octet called the Jazz Messengers, the first of his many groups bearing this name. In 1948, he visited Africa where he learned polyrhythmic drumming and was introduced to Islam, taking the name Abdullah Ibn Buhaina. \
\
\
The early 1950\'s, saw him performing and broadcasting with such musicians as [a=Miles Davis], [a=Clifford Brown], and [a=Horace Silver]. Blakey and Silver connected and formed the [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/262128-Art-Blakey-The-Jazz-Messengers]Jazz Messengers[/url]. This band soon evolved into [a262128] with Blakey remaining the leader with changing personnel, playing together with them until his death. From 1947 until 1972 he also recorded regularly with [a=Thelonious Monk].\
\
\
Blakey was a major figure in modern jazz and an important stylist in drums. His contribution to jazz as a discoverer and molder of young talent over three decades cannot be overlooked.',

\
\
[b]Frank Vincent Zappa[/b] was of Italian origins, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. [b] Frank Zappa[/b] grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock era, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [b][a=Igor Stravinsky][/b], [b][a=Karlheinz Stockhausen][/b] and [b][a=Edgard Varèse][/b]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late \'50s doo-wop, rock & roll and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the \'70s. However, [b]Zappa[/b] was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans - even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.\
\
\
[b]Zappa[/b] was also a prolific record-maker in his time, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [b][l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight][/b] & [b][l=Barking Pumpkin Records][/b] and through distribution deals with [b][l=Rykodisc][/b] and [b][l=Rhino Entertainment Company][/b]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [b][l=Warner Bros. Records][/b] and the now-defunct [b][l=MGM][/b]. In the \'80s, [b]Zappa[/b] then gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [b][l=Rykodisc][/b]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.\
\
\
In 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour. Sadly, that was the end of his live performing when, in late 1991, it was confirmed that [b]Zappa[/b] was seriously ill with cancer. Nevertheless, his schedule of album releases continued to be rapid. The [l301432] continues to this day with his wife [a498325] (aka [a2117913]) as the figurehead of the ZFT until her death in 2015.

\
American jazz drummer and bandleader perhaps best known for performing and recording satirical arrangements of popular songs. The songs receiving the Spike Jones treatment would commonly be punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells, and outlandish vocals. \
\
\
Through the 1940s and early 1950s, his band primarily recorded under the name [a=Spike Jones and his City Slickers]. They scored their first big hit in 1942 with \'Der Fuehrer\'s Face\', a song ridiculing Adolf Hitler that was later adapted by Walt Disney into an animated propaganda film intended to sell war bonds during WWII. Their 1944 rendition of \'Cocktails for Two\' was also very popular but, they are perhaps best known for the 1948 holiday release \'All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth\'\
\
\
The City Slickers preformed under a variety of names over the years, and some of the rotating cast of members followed Spike when he formed a second group of more serious musicians in 1946 called [a=Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra] which played lush arrangements of dance hits. In 1957 he revamped again with [a=Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun], a more straightforward big-band sound featuring a few tongue-in-cheek comic moments. \
\
\
He also hosted a series of TV programs in the mid to late 1950\'s, the most notable titled: The Spike Jones Show with his second wife, Helen Grayco, and young (at the time) son [a=Spike Jones Jr.]\

'real name: Kurtis Walker--Kurtis Blow was born Kurtis Walker in Harlem in 1959\
\
The first rapper to sign with a major record label, was instrumental in bringing rap from the underground to the masses. He began to immerse himself in the newborn hip-hop culture in the early \'70s; in 1976, he enrolled at City College of New York, where he became program director at the college\'s radio station. During his college years, Blow fell in with a group of friends, acquaintances and collaborators that would become the core of early-\'80s hip-hop. Blow worked with, among others, Grandmaster Flash, Russell Simmons and Mele Mel. After college, Blow embarked on his music career with Simmons as his manager and Simmons\'s younger brother Joey (who was once called \'son of Kurtis Blow\' and was later known as Run) working the turntables. In 1979, Blow recorded \'Christmas Rapping,\' a novelty single co-written by Billboard columnist Rocky Ford. The song was a hit, landing Blow a contract with Mercury Records. Later that year, Blow released his landmark \'The Breaks,\' included on Blow\'s self-titled debut. The record was a major success both within the hip-hop community and outside, with certified gold sales. It earned Blow a place in the pantheon of influential early rappers. Blow\'s early success was followed by a dry period in the early \'80s, when his Deuce and Tough albums failed to dent the charts. However, things picked up in 1984 with the release of the Ego Trip album, which featured the single \'Basketball.\' The next year, Blow made his film debut in Krush Groove. Blow\'s production work for artists such as Sweet G was also getting notice: He was named Producer of the Year in New York for three consecutive years (1983-85). However, Blow\'s career took a significant downturn thereafter. His 1986 album, \'Kingdom Blow\', was a commercial and critical flop, as was 1988\'s misnamed \'Back by Popular Demand\'. As his recording career wound down, Blow expanded his production work and became one of the first rappers to infiltrate mainstream television, appearing in commercials for Sprite in 1986 and writing rap segments for the soap opera \'One Life to Live\' in 1991-92.\

\
\
Smith became known as Johnny \'Hammond\' Smith in the mid-1950s as he emerged as an organ player, to avoid confusion with the guitarist John Smith, and the more famous organist Jimmy Smith. He dropped the Smith part of his name when he signed for the [l=Kudu] label in 1971. \
\
\
Smith played with Paul Williams and Chris Columbo before forming his own group. His bands featured singers [a=Etta Jones], Byrdie Green, saxophonists Houston Person, Earl Edwards, guitarists Eddie McFadden, Floyd Smith, James Clark, vibist Freddie McCoy. His career took off as he was serving as accompanist to singer [a=Nancy Wilson]. One of his last accomplishments also included Nancy Wilson. He wrote the song \'Quiet Fire\' for her \'Nancy Now\' release in 1989. \
\
\
After a 10-year spell on [l=Prestige Records] throughout the 60s resulting in a series of albums, he signed for soul/R&B influenced Kudu imprint of the well-regarded [l=CTI Records] label in 1971. His first album for CTI, \'Breakout\' was chosen that year to launch Kudu. The album featured Grover Washington Jr. as a sideman prior to the launch of his career as a solo recording artist. Three further albums followed on Kudu, as he decided to refer to himself as \'Johnny Hammond\', after deciding to drop \'Smith\' from his name. \
\
\
His style had become increasingly funky as he adapted to the style changes in music, culminating in two popular albums with the Mizell Brothers, \'Gambler\'s Life\' (1974) for the CTI offshoot, [l=Salvation Records (US)] and then in 1975, \'Gears\' after switching to another jazz label, [l=Milestone Records]. He began using electric and acoustic pianos, starting with \'Gambler\'s Life\', in addition to his signature instrument. Hammond\'s song \'Shifting Gears\' was featured on the breakbeat compilation Ultimate Breaks and Beats, and was also featured in the soundtrack of the 2006 video game Driver: Parallel Lines as well. \

\
Smith also taught at the Cal Poly Pomona music department for several years, beginning in January 1987. \

Hugo was given his first saxophone at the age of six. A child prodigy on sax and clarinet, he won first honors in national competitions and at age 9 was featured in Ripley’s Believe It Or Not for memorizing 76 classical compositions. An Amarillo High School graduate, he trained at the Eastman School of Music. Hugo toured extensively with the famous big bands of Jack Teagarden, Harry James, Tommy Dorsey and Sonny Burke appearing as a soloist, on the Burke Orchestra’s recording of Ella Fitzgerald 1951. In between gigs, he returned to Amarillo to lead his own band at the Nat, the Avalon, and the Aviatrix. He married Mary Lou Parr in 1951. Years before as a teenager, she’d danced to the music of the bandleader on stage who would later become her future husband of sixty-five years. Eventually settling in Amarillo, Hugo joined his father and brother in the family business, Hugo H Loewenstern Real Estate Co.\

He volunteered his band to the community, including the Lake Tanglewood (Amarillo, Texas) 4th of July celebrations, and nursing homes with singer wife Mary Lou. His professional career saw a solo album for Capitol Records, Who Said Good Music Is Dead, with the late composer Johnny Richards, who wrote original pieces for Hugo including The Magic of Arabis, which he performed as guest artist with the Amarillo Symphony in 1966. He continued musical associations with trumpeter, Doc Severinsen, Laurindo Almeida and others. Amarillo saw performances with friends and family in a newly formed jazz group. He was a founding member of the Amarillo Woodwind Quintet. The recording Music for Art, features songs by daughter, Tara Hugo and album sleeve artwork by Mary Lou.

\
\
Bourelly is most notable for his distinctively thick guitar sound and a penchant for mixing and bending styles ranging from funk, rock, jazz to atmospheric and psychedelic. He expresses himself frequently through different formations in order for him to explore his vast musical visions.\

Upon his arrival in Europe he founded African Boom Bop, featuring griot/singer [a=Abdourahmane Diop] with percussionist [a=Mino Cinelu].

He rose to success as the drummer for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, joining in 1975 after answering a newspaper ad that famously requested \'no junior Ginger Bakers\'. Weinberg\'s consistent beat gave the E Street Band a solid foundation until Springsteen dissolved it in 1989.\
\
Since the inception of Late Night with Conan O\'Brien in 1993, he has been the leader of that show\'s band, the Max Weinberg Seven. In the show, Weinberg\'s mellow persona is often a counter balance to Conan\'s sometimes excited and sarcastic nature. However, in many comedy skits, Weinberg is presented as a twisted character with various sexual fetishes. In the past several years, especially since the departure of Late Night cohost Andy Richter, Max has had less of a presence in the show. Once Springsteen reunited the E Street Band in 1999, Weinberg began taking leaves of absence from the show in order to go out on tour.\
\
Weinberg is the author of The Big Beat: Conversations with Rock\'s Greatest Drummers (1991), a series of interviews with drummers from all eras, as well as a companion series of CDs released on Rhino Records. The Max Weinberg Seven released a self-titled album in 2000.\

\
\
\'Art is dangerous. It is one of the attractions: when it ceases to be dangerous you don\'t want it.\' Duke Ellington. \
\
\
Ellington was an outstanding composer. He wrote thousands of works, composing popular songs, art songs, a wide variety of instrumentals, suites, symphonic works, movie and TV scores, and music for ballet – all of a very high quality. \
\
\
But to say merely that Ellington was a great composer ignores his achievement as a musician. Ellington is probably the only musician whose name has been associated with a particular style \'Ellingtonia\'. This style does not imply a specific tempo or specific mood, but also a certain standard of quality. Whoever plays \'Ellingtonia\' must adhere to these standards. Many significant bands have attempted to copy his style. \
\
\
For Jazz, Ellington was the first orchestra leader to substitute voices for instruments, he popularized the Baritone Sax when he engaged [a=Harry Carney], he influenced countless bands and dance orchestras. \
\
\
Beginning with his \'Jungle Band\' to his \'Famous Orchestra\' which appeared at Carnegie Hall numerous times and even introduced several Jazz suite that Duke had composed, Ellington his the most successful and important orchestra leader in Jazz history. Success did not come easily taking him many years of devoted work to make a name for himself. \
\
\
He began as a Ragtime pianist in his hometown of Washington. His first composition was \'Soda Fountain Rag\' which he never recorded. In 1922 he led a fairly successful band which featured [a=Sonny Greer] and [a=Otto Hardwick]. Several years later, when he opened at the New York Kentuky Club he succeeded in capture the public fancy. This was the first band to capture the now legendary Ellington sound which is clearly present in the number \'The Creeper\', recorded at the end of 1926. \
\
\
On 12 April 1927, Duke & his orchestra began the engagement which was to make him world famous: Irvin Mills brought them to the Cotton Club, where they stayed five years. There he laid the Jungle, the Mood and other styles. From December 1926 to October 1930 the Ellington band spent at least 64 days in the studios of 14 recording companies, using 18 different pseudonyms for his band, they recorded about 170 titles. \
\
\
He is also the father of [a=Mercer Ellington]. \

Williams first learned violin, but disliked the instrument and instead took up tuba while in high school. During the early 1930s he played tuba, then double bass, in Southern territory bands. In 1936 he moved to New York, where he took part in several recording sessions with Henry \'Red\' Allen (1936-1937), played with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band (1937-1938), recorded with Buster Bailey (December 1938), and worked briefly with Benny Carter. In 1939 he made the first of several recordings with Billie Holiday (to 1942, under the leadership of Holiday or Teddy Wilson), played with Frankie Newton at the downtown location of Café Society, recorded with Harry James, James P. Johnson, J. C. Higginbotham, the Port of Harlem Jazzmen, the Port of Harlem Seven, Newton, and Sidney Bechet, and joined Coleman Hawkin’s band. After leaving Hawkins the following year Williams played with Louis Armstrong until 1941. In summer 1941 he joined Wilson’s sextet (for illustration see Wilson, Teddy), with which he appeared in the film short \'Boogie Woogie Dream\' (1941). He recorded with his fellow sideman Edmond Hall in January 1944 and remained at Café Society under Hall’s leadership when Wilson disbanded in May 1944. During these years he was occasionally reunited with Armstrong, most notably at a concert involving Hall’s band at Carnegie Hall in February 1947. When Hall disbanded in mid-June 1947, Williams joined Tab Smith at the Savoy Ballroom (to 1952) and Johnny Hodges (c1952-1955). He then ceased working as a full-time musician, but in 1968 he traveled to France with Buddy Tate, and in the 1970s he worked frequently with Red Richards. He also toured with Bob Greene’s concert troupe, the World of Jelly Roll Morton, from 1978 to 1982, and with the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band from 1978 until June 1998, when a stroke ended his career.',

\
\
Guitar player - one of the 3 or 4 most highly rated in jazz history.\
\
\
Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 (Early Influence). \
\
\
Career began with occasional gigs as a bass player in various combos around Oklahoma in the early days of the Depression. He spent more than a year with pianist Alphonso Trent\'s sextet, which played in Casper, Wyoming, and Deadwood, South Dakota. Early inspiration for Christian came from [a=Lester Young], who came to town with [a=Walter Page]\'s Blue Devils to play the season at the Ritz Ballroom in 1931. The Ritz was a white ballroom, and the black players had to be content to do their jamming after hours in Slaughter\'s Hall on East 2nd Street - or \'Deep Second\' as it was called. Here Christian and his brothers, Hot Lips Page, Lem Johnson, Eddie Durham, Harry Smith, Hobart Banks, Little Dog, James Simpson and other early players gathered to trade ideas and try to top one another, developing on their chosen instruments.\
\
\
During this period Christian learned from a variety of guitar players with whom he came into contact: Tommy Lee House, Charlie Faris, Claude Burns and Ralph \'Chuck\' Hamilton. Perhaps his biggest influence at this point was James \'Jim Daddy\' Walker, one of the stars of Clarence Love\'s orchestra from Kansas City. Love played Oklahoma City many times from 1933 onwards, and in their first encounters, Walker (4 years Christian\'s senior) gave him many a lesson in guitar mastery. Other ideas came from [a=Eddie Durham], who Christian heard a year or so later featuring with Jimmie Lunceford\'s band, and playing a guitar with a resonator. By the time Walker and Christian met again in 1936, however, Christian had developed enormously and was well able to handle the older player.\
\
\
Christian left Oklahoma City in 1939 at the age of 23, on the promptings of Mary Lou Williams and John Hammond, and soon joined [a=Benny Goodman]\'s band. Over the next 3 years he would tour across the US with Goodman, and achieve huge popularity. Recordings - both live broadcasts and in the studio (for Columbia and others) also followed. He won the Down Beat Poll for Best Jazz Guitarist in 1939, \'40 and \'41, and equivalent Metronome polls in 1940 and \'41. \
\
\
In June 1941 Christian\'s health failed and he was quickly admitted to first Bellevue, then Seaview hospital in NY. He was never able to recover from the tuberculosis, and died 9 months later.\

'Gary Bartz':\
'real name: Gary Lee Bartz--b. 26th September 1940, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.\
\
Gary Bartz took up the alto sax at the age of eleven.\
\
As a teenager Gary had played sax in his father\'s nightclub, sitting in with Art Blakey and George Benson.\
\
He had started on alto at age 11 and, after studying at Juilliard and the Peabody Conservatory, Bartz worked with the Max Roach-Abbey Lincoln group in 1964.\
\
He followed that up by stints with Art Blakey\'s Jazz Messengers (1965-66), McCoy Tyner and Blue Mitchell.\
\
Bartz made a strong impression with Miles Davis\' 1970-71 fusion group, emerging as perhaps the strongest soloist on the recording \'Live / Evil\'.\
\
The altoist, who had recorded as a leader for Milestone and Prestige fairly regularly since 1967, did some of his finest work at the 1973 Montreux Jazz Festival (released on Prestige as \'I\'ve Known Rivers and Other Bodies\').\
\
In 1970 he worked with Miles Davis, then in 1972 switched to the Prelude label and moved towards fusing soul R & B with jazz in his music.\
\
By the mid seventies his recordings became funkier and more commercial.\
\
His 1977 album \'Music Is My Sanctuary\' is considered one of the finest fusion albums of it\'s generation, with the title track receiving \'rare groove\' status.\
\
1978\'s \'Love Affair\' on Capitol (which featured an excellent revised version of John Coltrane\'s \'Giant Steps\') which was well received in soul and jazz circles.\
\
His next move was to Arista where he worked with writers / producers Mtume / Lucas on the single \'Music\', taken from the album \'Bartz\' (1980).\
\
He also recorded with The Blackbyrds and Rena Scott.\
\
By 1987, Bartz started recording more mainstream jazz style albums for Mapleshade, SteepleChase and Candid.\
\
Gary Bartz is an underrated (and often totally overlooked) jazz great.\

'Esther Phillips':\
'real name: Esther Mae Jones--Esther Phillips (born December 23, 1935, Galveston, Texas, USA - died August 7, 1984, Carson, California, USA) was an American soul and blues singer who was an influence on many other artists including [a38863].\
\
\
A mature singer at age fourteen, she won the amateur talent contest in 1949 at the Barrelhouse Club owned by [a=Johnny Otis]. Otis was so impressed he added her to his traveling revue, the California Rhythm and Blues Caravan, billed as \'Little Esther Phillips\'. Her first hit record was \'Double Crossing Blues\' (#1 R+B), recorded in 1950 for [l=Savoy Records].  Her duet with [a=Mel Walker] on \'Mistrusting Blues\', also went to number one that year, as did \'Cupid Boogie\'. Other Phillips records that made it onto the U.S. Billboard R&B chart in 1950 include \'Misery\' (#9), \'Deceivin\'\' (#4), \'Wedding Boogie\' (#6), and \'Faraway Blues\' (#6). Few artists, R&B or otherwise, have ever enjoyed such success in their debut year. Phillips left Otis and the Savoy label at the end of 1950 and signed with [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Federal+Records+%282%29]Federal Records[/url]. Although she recorded more than thirty sides for Federal, only one, \'Ring-a-Ding-Doo\', charted; making it to #8 in 1952. Not working with Otis was part of her problem; the other part was her drug usage. By the middle of the decade Phillips was chronically addicted to drugs.\
\
\
Phillips ultimately got well enough to launch a comeback in 1962. Now billed as Esther Phillips instead of Little Esther, she recorded a country tune, \'Release Me,\' with producer [a1229104]. This went to number 1 on R&B and number 8 on the pop listings. After several other minor R&B hits on [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Lenox+Records]Lenox[/url], she was signed by [l681] Records. Her cover of [a82730]\' song \'And I Love Him\' nearly made the R&B Top Ten in 1965 and The Beatles flew her to the UK for her first overseas performances.\
\
\
During the 1970\'s she made a temporary move into disco material and scored an international hit with \'What A Difference A Day Made\', an updating of the 1930\'s jazz standard\

Phillips died at UCLA Medical Center in Carson, California in 1984, at the age of 48 from liver and kidney failure.',

\
\
Composer, bandleader and inventor Raymond Scott was among the unheralded pioneers of contemporary experimental music.\
\
\
Of all of Scott\'s accomplishments of 1949, however, none was more important than the Electronium, one of the first synthesizers ever created. An \'instantaneous composing machine,\' the Electronium generated original music via random sequences of tones, rhythms, and timbres; Scott himself denied it was a prototype synthesizer — it had no keyboard — but as one of the first machines to create music by means of artificial intelligence, its importance in pointing the way towards the electonic compositions of the future is undeniable. His other inventions included the \'Karloff,\' an early sampler capable of recreating sounds ranging from sizzling steaks to jungle drums; the Clavinox, a keyboard Theremin complete with an electronic sub-assembly designed by a then 23-year-old Robert Moog; and the Videola, which fused together a keyboard and a TV screen to aid in composing music for films and other moving images.\
\
\
By the middle of the 1960s, Scott began turning increasingly away from recording and performing to focus on writing and inventing; a 1969 musical celebrating the centennial of Kentucky Bourbon was his last orchestral work, with his remaining years spent solely on electronic composition. Among his latter-day innovations was an early programmable polyphonic sequencer, which along with the Electronium later caught the attention of Motown chief Berry Gordy Jr., who in 1971 tapped Scott to head the label\'s electronic music research and development team. After retiring six years later, he continued writing — his last known piece, 1986\'s \'Beautiful Little Butterfly,\' was created on MIDI technology. \

\
Nigerian singer, guitarist and composer. Sonny Okosuns added the final “s” to his surname in adulthood. He was referred to by both names. A self-taught guitar player, in 1964, at the age of 17, Sonny formed the Postmen, a covers band also known as the \'Local Beatles\'. He visited London with a theatre group for the 1965 1st Commonwealth Arts Festival, but in 1967 the Biafran war prompted both the dissolution of the Postmen and a move by Okosun and his family to Lagos. There, he worked briefly in television before moving to Benin, where in 1969 he joined Victor Uwaifo\'s Melody Maestros as a second guitarist. \
\
He formed his first professional band in 1971 called Paperback Ltd., which he disbanded in 1974 and went on to form Ozziddi in 1976. Widely popular in the West African region during the late 1970\'s and early 1980\'s, he enjoyed some international attention, most notably for his cooperation with Eddy Grant in several releases. Of these, the album \'Fire In Soweto\' with its hit title tune was to enjoy the largest success. \
\
By the late Eighties, Okosun\'s star was fading, but he reinvented himself as \'Evangelist Sonny Okosuns\' and with the 1994 comeback album \'Songs of Praise\', which sold nearly a million copies, rode a wave of Christian evangelism in Nigeria to become that country\'s foremost gospel musician. In 1998, he founded the House of Prayer Ministry, converting part of his expansive building to a church. ',

Handy\'s musical beginnings were fostered under the tutelage of pianist [a=Aaron Copland]. While he had an impressive career as a pianist and arranger, he is best known in retrospect for his bebop arrangements.\
\
Handy first worked professionally as a swing pianist for Michael Loring in 1938, but was drafted into the army in 1940. From 1944 to 1946 he was a member of the Boyd Raeburn Orchestra, composing and performing on piano. This was at a time when many big bands were transforming their music toward bebop. He did leave the orchestra briefly to work for Paramount Studios, but soon returned to Raeburn. This was one of his most creative periods, making arrangements of older standards with a distinctly bebop quality. Just as he was entering his prime, however, he had a falling out with Raeburn and left. While he continued to arrange for other bands, it is that 1944–1946 period for which he is remembered most.',

Improving her vocal and piano technique during this time, she first recorded with Nat Pierce in 1949, later recording with the Beryl Booker trio and with several other small groups from 1954-1955 (recordings which were available on three albums for Storyville). She then toured with George Shearing for two years beginning in the summer of 1952, and for a time was managed by the famed George Wein.  King later began performing for a time in Las Vegas. \
\
\
Ultimately signing with RCA, she recorded three albums for the label, beginning with 1956\'s Bidin\' My Time. She also had some minor chart success with the singles \'Mr. Wonderful\' (which made the Top 20 in 1956), \'Married I Can Always Get\' and \'Say It Isn\'t So\' (both of which made the Hot 100 from 1957–1958). Her critically praised 1959 album All the Kings\' Songs found her interpreting the signature songs of contemporary male singers like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole (the \'kings\' of the title).  In the 1960s, she opened the Playboy Club, where she often performed. After developing lupus, she managed to make a brief comeback with a 1977 album featuring Dave McKenna, and with two more albums recorded for Audiophile released posthumously. She eventually died of the disease on November 18, 1977. King\'s style, influenced by Lee Wiley, Mildred Bailey and Mabel Mercer, has won her a small but devoted cult following. \

\
American drummer and vocalist. Best known for his work with [a=Frank Zappa] and original drummer in the first line-up of \'[url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/286086-Mothers-The]The Mothers[/url]\', with his introductory line \'Hi, boys and girls - I’m Jimmy Carl Black, and I’m the Indian of the group”. Also referred to by [a=Don Van Vliet] as \'Indian Ink\' during their musical association. Black co-founded several groups and featured on many recordings after departing Zappa\'s band - with whom he made the first 8 albums. However, JCB appeared on some Zappa works thereafter, such as the vocalist on \'Harder Than Your Husband\' - a number on which he can also be seen performing with FZ (in Albuquerque) on friend John Cline\'s vid-clip on YouTube (To which FZ agreed).\
\
\
JCB met his wife Moni ([a3133949]) at a gig (whilst drumming with the Farrell/Black Blues Band) in Traunstein, Germany when he was 58. He spoke no German and she spoke no English, although the fact she had been a devoted Mothers fan for 25 years obviously helped communications and they married 11 months later. Soulmates until he passed away, Moni regularly accompanied him to Zappanale events. Black had almost completed a book of his life story when he died and it was finally published in the Fall of 2013, entitled \'For Mother\'s Sake - The Memoirs And Recollections Of Jimmy Carl Black 1938-2008\'.\

'Al Haig':\
'real name: Allan Warren Haig--American jazz pianist and one of the pioneers of bebop.\
\
Born :  July 19, 1922 in Newark, New Jersey.\
\
Died :  November 16, 1982 in New York City, New York.  (Heart attack)\
\
\
Al started playing with [a=Dizzy Gillespie] and [a=Charlie Parker] in 1945 [2], and performed and recorded under Gillespie from 1945 to 1946, as a member of [a=Eddie Davis And His Beboppers] in 1946 (also featuring [a=Fats Navarro]), and [a=Eddie Davis And His Quintet] in 1947, under Parker from 1948 to 1950, and under [a=Stan Getz] from 1949 to 1951. The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for [l=Guild Records] in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the celebrated nonet on the first session of [a=Miles Davis]\' Birth of the Cool. Although Haig became known for his distinctive and pioneering bebop style, he in fact spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.\
\
\
In 1969 Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey on 9 October 1968. He had said in evidence that his wife had been drunk, and had died in a fall down a flight of stairs. Grange Rutan, Haig\'s second wife, challenged Haig\'s account in her 2007 book, Death of a Bebop Wife. Rutan\'s book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie\'s story in detail, describing an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan notes that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig\'s violent personality that went unheeded. Importantly, she quotes bassist [a=Harold Gaylor], who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie\'s death.\
\
\
In 1974 Haig was invited to tour Europe by [a=Tony Williams (13)], owner of [l=Spotlite Records] in the UK. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the \'Invitation\' album for Spotlite, with [a=Gilbert Rovère], on bass and [a=Kenny Clarke] on drums. This kick-started his re-emergence and over the next eight years he built a strong following in Europe and toured several times, recording in the UK and France, and appearing elsewhere. He recorded for several Japanese labels',

«When he played with Count Basie, everyone knew that Freddie Green was half the orchestra on his own, the man who helped the band breathe. He was the \'working lung\', and as an accompanist he played \'four-to-the-bar\' like nobody else.

'Donald Byrd':\
'real name: Donaldson Toussaint L\'Ouverture Byrd II--American jazz trumpeter, composer, bandleader and educator.\
\
\
Born: 9 December 1932 in Detroit, Michigan, USA.\
\
Died: 4 February 2013 in Dover, Delaware, USA (aged 80).\
\
\
Byrd attended Cass Tech, where he studied classical music and was mentored by the band director [a=Dr. Harry Begian], a disciplinarian. He played trumpet in military bands during a stint in the Air Force from 1951–1953, before graduating from Wayne State University in 1954 with a music degree. Like other young Detroit jazz musicians, he also studied with bebop pianist [a=Barry Harris (2)].\
\
\
Byrd\'s warmly burnished sound, fluent technique and aggressive-yet-graceful swing was rooted in the style of Clifford Brown, but his gangly, rhythmically loose phrasing was a unique calling card right from the get-go. As Byrd matured in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he tempered his hummingbird flourishes with a cooler sensibility and phrasing.\
\
\
Byrd recorded prolifically both as a sideman and a leader, appearing on scores of recordings on the [l=Savoy Records], [l=Prestige], [l=Riverside Records] and [l=Blue Note] labels. He led a feisty quintet with his old pal from Detroit, baritone saxophonist [a=Pepper Adams], from 1958–1961. Byrd also gave a young pianist from Chicago named [a=Herbie Hancock] his first major exposure by hiring him in 1961.\
\
\
As a composer, Byrd was proficient in church-inspired shouts, funky and sophisticated blues forms and structurally interesting originals. He had a wider field of vision than many of his peers, exemplified by his influential 1963 LP, “A New Perspective” (Blue Note), which married his small group with a gospel choir.\
\
\
Byrd never stopped going to school. He earned a master\'s degree in music education from the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1950s, studied composition with the famous classical pedagogue [a=Nadia Boulanger] in France in the early 1960s, earned a law degree from Howard University in 1976 and a doctorate from Columbia Teachers College in New York in the early 1980s.\
\
\
Beginning in the 1960s, Byrd taught at many universities, most notably Rutgers, Howard and North Carolina Central.\
\
\
By the early 1970s, Byrd had begun exploring a danceable fusion of jazz, R&B and soul. In 1973, he teamed with current and former students at Howard, where he was chairman of the black music department, to make the best-selling LP “Black Byrd”. Produced by brothers [a=Larry Mizell & Fonce Mizell], the record and its sequels elevated Byrd into a crossover star.',

'Irving Ashby':\
'real name: Irving C. Ashby--Born : December 29, 1920 in Someville, Massachusetts.\
\
Died : April 22, 1987 in Perris, California.\
\
During the rock & roll era, Irving Ashby was a prolific session guitarist in and around Los Angeles, where he worked as a freelance musician. But like so many session players on R&R records, he was basically a jazzman, who had to adapt to the Big Beat in order to pay the bills. Irving Ashby was in demand primarily for his solid rhythm playing, but he was also a very adept soloist. Ashby began playing guitar at age nine. In 1940 he joined [a=Lionel Hampton]\'s band and continued playing with Hampton for two years. Ashby is the guitarist on Hampton\'s influential \'Flying Home\' (1942). In 1947 he joined [a=Nat King Cole]\'s Trio, replacing [a=Oscar Moore]. He joined [a=Oscar Peterson]\'s trio in 1952 and was a prominent member of [a=Norman Granz]\'s Jazz at the Philharmonic at that time. He also led his own sextet, with which he recorded for [l=United Artists Records], and was active as a teacher, publishing a guitar instruction book in the process. In the mid and late 50\'s Ashby was more often found in the recording studios, both as a guitarist and an upright bass player. For the [l=Imperial] label he played on many instrumental recordings, first with [a=The Ernie Freeman Combo], later with drummer [a=Sandy Nelson]. Ashby also recorded instrumentals under his own name. By the 60\'s Ashby was also working outside the music field, but continued playing from time to time, sometimes brought back into the limelight by various guitarists whom he had strongly influenced, such as [a=Howard Roberts].\

'Gene Bianco':\
'real name: Eugene Capobianco--Born Eugene Capobianco 29 March 1927, Hartford, Connecticut, jazz enthusiast Gene Bianco started off his career as a classical virtuoso harpist, and toured with major orchestras to rave reviews. His love for jazz, however, prompted him to explore the concept of using harp as a jazz instrument, an idea that was hitherto unheard of. Having appeared as a solo act in a variety of New York nightclubs, he later teamed up with guitarist Mundell Lowe and percussionist Joe Venuto to form a jazz trio which released an album on the obscure Major Records label. Soon after, RCA signed the group to a three-album contract, under which the albums \'Stringin\' the Standards\' and \'Harp, Skip and Jump!\' were released. \
\
\
However, RCA had a different idea of where the harp belonged. For a new record club partnership with Readers Digest, RCA bought out the existing contract and entered into a new contract with Gene Bianco which obliged him to produce easy-listening albums catered to the \'middle-class market\' (as described by a certain author). The first album, Joy To The World, was a hit. By then, Gene Bianco had been recast as \'The Rainbow Sounds of Bianco\' with his own personal logo on the front of his albums, which enjoyed first-class productions, and a full orchestra.\
\
\
Nonetheless, Bianco prefers and opted for the anonymity and independence of life as a freelance session jazz musician, and ended up playing on dozens of great jazz recordings, such as all three of Paul Desmond\'s string albums, on Gil Evans\' \'Blues in Orbit\', on Herbie Mann\'s \'Push, Push\', Alan Lorber\'s \'Lotus Palace\', and others. He also recorded with some of the best jazz singers around, including Carmen McCrae and Marlena Shaw. Some of his best session work of the 1960s and 1970s now shows up on sampling favorites such as the Blue Break Beats.\
\
\
After 30 years as a studio player, Bianco went into the recording booth as a musical coordinator and contractor, screening and hiring musicians for recording sessions. Respected throughout the business, he worked with acts as diverse as Mary J. Blige, D Train, Stevie Nicks, Natalie Cole, and even Ray Charles. Recently, he put together the orchestra that accompanied tenor saxman Joe Lovano on Viva Caruso. He and Mundell Lowe even pioneered an instrument combining the harp and electric guitar that is now a standard feature of many pop orchestrations. \
\
\
Bianco\'s grandfather is Fillippo Capobianco, who was also a successful harpist in Italy.\

\
Other defining recordings include \'Sugar Town\', the 1967 number one \'Somethin\' Stupid\' (a duet with her father), the title song from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood such as \'Jackson\', and her cover of Cher\'s \'Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\', which features during the opening sequence of Quentin Tarantino\'s Kill Bill.\
\
Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in the early 1960s, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with \'These Boots Are Made for Walkin\'\', which showed her provocative but good-natured style, and which popularized and made her synonymous with go-go boots. The promo clip featured a big-haired Sinatra and six young women in tight tops, go-go boots and mini-skirts. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including the critical and cult favorite \'Some Velvet Morning\'. In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.\

\
\
Born: 4 January 1942 in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, England, UK. \
\
\
A household name since the early 1970s, John McLaughlin was a fusion guitarist when he led the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra]. He started on guitar when he was 11 and was initially inspired by blues and swing players. He worked with [a=David Bowie], [a=Alexis Korner], [a=Graham Bond], [a=Ginger Baker], and many others in the 1960s, and played free jazz with [a=Gunter Hampel] for six months. His first album was a classic, \'[m=75355]\' (1969), and was followed by an obscurity for the [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url] label with [a=John Surman], a quintet set with [a=Larry Young] on album \'[m=75603]\' (1970), and half acoustic solos and half jams involving Indian musicians on \'[m=75623]\' (1971). \
\
\
In 1969, McLaughlin moved to New York to play with [a=Tony Williams]\' [a=Lifetime] and he appeared on two classic [a=Miles Davis] records: \'[m=8408]\' (1969) and \'[m=8260]\' (1970). In 1971 McLaughlin formed the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra], a very powerful group often thought of as rock but having the sophisticated improvisations of jazz. After three influential albums – \'[m=72307]\' (1971), \'[m=72290]\' (1973), and \'[m=72279]\' (1973) – the group disbanded in late 1973. \
\
\
McLaughlin, who recorded a powerful spiritual album with [a=Carlos Santana] that was influenced by [a=John Coltrane], put together a new Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1974 that, despite the inclusion of [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], failed to catch on and broke up by 1975. McLaughlin then surprised the music world by radically shifting directions, switching to acoustic guitar and playing Indian music with his group Shakti. They made a strong impact on the nascent world music scene during their three years. McLaughlin then went back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars; leading [a=The One Truth Band]; playing in trios with [a=Al DiMeola] and [a=Paco De Lucia]; popping up on some mid-1980s [a=Miles Davis] records; forming a short-lived third version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra with saxophonist [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/503619-Bill-Evans-3]Bill Evans[/url]; recording an introspective tribute to pianist [a=Bill Evans]; and in 1993, touring with a rollicking jazz trio featuring [a=Joey DeFrancesco] and drummer [a=Dennis Chambers]. \
\
\
Throughout his productive career McLaughlin has recorded as a leader across labels, including [l=Marmalade], [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/442686-Dawn-7]Dawn[/url], [l=Douglas], [l=CBS], [l=Warner Brothers], and [l=Verve]. \

'real name: Patrick Bruce Metheny--Pat Metheny was born in Kansas City on August 12, 1954 into a musical family. Starting on trumpet at the age of 8, Metheny switched to guitar at age 12. By the age of 15, he was working regularly with the best jazz musicians in Kansas City, receiving valuable on-the-bandstand experience at an unusually young age. Metheny first burst onto the international jazz scene in 1974. Over the course of his three-year stint with vibraphone great Gary Burton, the young Missouri native already displayed his soon-to-become trademarked playing style, which blended the loose and flexible articulation customarily reserved for horn players with an advanced rhythmic and harmonic sensibility - a way of playing and improvising that was modern in conception but grounded deeply in the jazz tradition of melody, swing, and the blues. With the release of his first album, Bright Size Life (1975), he reinvented the traditional “jazz guitar” sound for a new generation of players. Throughout his career, Pat Metheny has continued to re-define the genre by utilizing new technology and constantly working to evolve the improvisational and sonic potential of his instrument.\

'real name: Ronald Theodore Kirk--Born August 7, 1935 in Columbus, Ohio, USA.\
\
Died December 5, 1977 in Bloomington, Indiana, USA (of a stroke).\
\
\
He was best known for being a blind jazz saxophonist who could play more than one wind instrument at once. Kirk played a number of musical instruments, mainly various saxophones, clarinets and flutes. His main instruments were tenor saxophone and two obscure saxophones: the stritch and the manzello. Kirk modified these instruments himself to accommodate his simultaneous playing technique. The idea of playing more than one saxophone at the same time occurred to him in a dream and he set out to make it a reality. Around 1970 he added \'Rahsaan\' to his name after hearing it in a dream. He is also noted for his circular breathing technique and was reportedly able to sustain a note for over an hour.\

One of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century, Thelonious Monk had a idiosyncratic improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire. He is often regarded as one of the founders of bebop. Monk\'s prolific compositions and improvisations are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists.  His  unorthodox approach to the piano combines a highly percussive attack with abrupt, use of silence and dramatic pauses. He was also known for a distinct fashion sense in his suits, hats and trademark sunglasses. Monk was an unconventional stage presence, known for getting up from his piano to dance (sometimes in a counter-clockwise motion  which drew comparisons to ring-shout and Muslim Sufi whirling) while his band members were still playing. Monk is one of only five jazz musicians to date to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, which puts him in a select company with [a=Louis Armstrong], [a=Duke Ellington], [a=Wynton Marsalis], and [a=Dave Brubeck]. \

In 1956 he moved to New York City and launched his jazz career performing with artists such as [a30486], [a37733], [a261286], [a263796], and [a253777]. His debut album, \'Back Country Suite\', was issued on the [l19591] label in 1957. He formed his own trio in 1958.\
\
\
It was not until 1963 that his record label allowed him to release an album entirely of vocals. Entitled \'Mose Allison Sings\', it was a collection of songs that paid tribute to artists of the Mojo Triangle: [a287849] (\'Eyesight to the Blind\'), [a386791] (\'That\'s All Right\') and [a166684] (\'The Seventh Son\'). However, it was an original composition in the album that brought him the most attention – \'Parchman Farm\'. For more than two decades, \'Parchman Farm\' was his most requested song. He dropped it from his playlist in the 1980\'s because some critics felt it was politically incorrect. Allison explained to [i]Nine-O-One Network Magazine[/i]: \'I don\'t do the cotton sack songs much anymore. You go to the Mississippi Delta and there are no cotton sacks. It\'s all machines and chemicals.\'\
\
\
His 1987 recorded album \'Ever Since The World Ended\' - Blue Note 48015  received the highest rating (5 starts) in Down Beat February 1988.\
\
\
Prestige Records tried to market Allison as a pop star, but [l1866] and later [l681] tried to market him as a blues artist. Because he sang blues, [i]Jet[/i] magazine thought that he was black and wanted to interview him.\
\
\
Allison was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006.\
\
\
Allison\'s March 2010 album, \'The Way of the World\', \'marked his return to the recording studio after a 12-year absence.\'\
\
\
In 2012, Allison was honored with a blues marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in his hometown of Tippo. On January 14, 2013, Allison was honored as a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts at a ceremony at Lincoln Center in New York. The NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship is the nation\'s highest honor in jazz.\
\
\
Allison wrote some 150 songs. His own performances have been described as \'delivered in a casual conversational way with a melodic southern accented tone that has a pitch and range ideally suited to his idiosyncratic phrasing, laconic approach and ironic sense of humor.\'',

He scored the TV movies \'My Sweet Charlie,\' \'That Certain Summer,\' four early episodes of \'Columbo\' and the first four episodes of the cult series \'Kolchak: The Night Stalker.\'\

His music lent itself to sci-fi and horror projects, including orchestral scores for the pilot of \'The Six Million Dollar Man\' and the four-hour \'Frankenstein: The True Story\' (1973), which he recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra. Melle created landmark electronic scores for sci-fi TV movies including \'A Cold Night\'s Death\' and the four-hour \'World War III.\' He wrote and performed music for several telefilms dealing with sensational murders, including \'Fatal Vision,\' Ted Bundy story \'The Deliberate Stranger\' and \'The Case of the Hillside Strangler.\'\

'James Mtume':\
'real name: James Foreman--James Mtume was raised in a musical family where his father and uncles formed a band \'The Heath Brothers\'. Already in the sixties, James Mtume studied percussion and soon after this, he also acquired the guitar playing skills. It didn\'t take long before he played together with artists like Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard and eventually became the percussionist for Miles Davis. In the Miles Davis band, Reggie Lucas played guitar, and it was with Reggie Lucas that James Mtume started a song writing partnership. The duo Lucas/Mtume wrote numerous tracks for various artists in the timeframe 77-82. Without a doubt, the most famous being the all-time Stephanie Mills classic, \'I never knew love like this before\'. \
\
\
It was for his own project, Mtume, that James Mtume applied his most innovative sounds. The first result was the album \'In search of the rainbow seekers\' The Mtume band also featured the remarkable and perhaps one of the most underrated vocalists : Tawatha Agee. As a band, Mtume scored its first big success with Juicy Fruit, the title track of the second album. Numerous artists have sampled this superb classy funk combined with a touch of eroticism masterpiece. In 1984 James Mtume took one step further into his very own style of sparse minimalistic heavy percussion based funk sound. Today his 1984 \'You me and he\' album stands like the ultimate Mtume album. \
\
\
In 1986, Mtume hits the music stores again with the album \'Theatre of the mind\'. This is an even further exploration into a new minimal funk and socially engaged music. Listen to Deepfreeze, P.O.P. generation or New face Deli, being protest songs against the new generation of media boosted artists, where video culture is gaining more influence than sheer musical value. A year later, James Mtume decides to leave this part of the music scene. He later admits that he could no longer cope with the new culture and breed of artists and record companies that focused more on fast money, fashion trends and shock values than on musical value and education. Meanwhile, James Mtume found an outlet for his musical creativity as musical director of a NY theatre.\

'real name: Elvin Ray Jones--Elvin Jones was born September 9, 1927 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA.\
\
Died on May 18, 2004, Englewood, New Jersey, USA, from heart failure.\
\
\
Called by Life magazine \'the world\'s greatest rhythmic drummer\'. He had two musician brothers:  [a=Hank Jones], a jazz pianist, and [a=Thad Jones], a trumpet and flugelhorn player. Jones entered the Detroit jazz scene in the late 1940s after touring as a stagehand with the Army Special Services show Operation Happiness. After a brief gig at the Detroit club Grand River Street, he went to work at another club, backing up such jazz greats as Parker, Davis and Wardell Grey. Jones, with his rhythmic, innovative style, became one of jazz\'s most famous drummers under Coltrane. \
\
\
By age 13, determined to be a drummer, Elvin was practicing eight to ten hours a day. In 1946 Elvin enlisted in the Army, and toured with a Special Services show called Operation Happiness - as a stagehand. Unofficially, however, he was honing his own musical skills and gaining confidence, playing at post social affairs. Jones was discharged in 1949, returning to a Detroit musical scene that was as vibrant as any outside New York. Elvin began to frequent the Bluebird Inn. In time, Jeader Billy Mitchell hired Elvin, and in three years at the club he backed up visiting stars including the legendary Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, Wardell Grey, and, for six months, Miles Davis. In Addition, Monday nights there were jam sessions Elvin organized at his home. The long list of musicians Elvin played with during this period includes Miles Davis, Sonny Stitt, Tommy Flanagan, Pepper Adams, Barry Harris, Kenny Burrell, Milt Jackson, Lou Hayes and Yusef Lateef. Elvin made his move to New York ostensibly to audition for a new Benny Goodman band. Instead, he ended up with Charles Mingus, and in subsequent years he developed his style with Bud Powell, Miles Davis, the Pepper Adams-Donald Byrd Quintet, Art Farmer and J.J. Johnson. He also had his first experiences playing with Miles\' tenor man and the increasingly celebrated recording artist John Coltrane. After leaving Miles in 1960, Coltrane was touring in San Francisco with his new group when he flew back to New York to seek out Elvin. Through 1966, Elvin contributed to some of the most controversial, influential, and ultimately important music in jazz. Among the triumphant recordings from his great association are \'A love Supreme\' and \'Coltrane \'Live\' at the Village Vanguard\'. In March 1966, Elvin left Coltrane. After a brief European tour with Duke Ellington\'s band he returned to New York to begin his distinguished career as leader, with a series of innovative piano-less trios featuring Joe Farrell on tenor alto and flute, and one of several bassists including Jimmy Garrison, Bill Wood, Charlie Haden and Wilbur Little. Elvin has been heard on nearly 500 recordings, with no end in sight. He also made a temporary detour to Hollywood in 1971 to appear as the character Job Cain in the ABC Paramount film \'Zachariah\'. Reflecting his deep commitment to the music \'Playing is not something I do at night\' he said, \'It\'s my function in life\'.\

\
The voice, charisma and talent of Celia Cruz have created one of the most impressive careers in all of music. Merely listing her accomplishments would require a book. Her more than 70 albums have yielded an unending harvest of gold and platinum records, and she has received more than a hundred awards from prestigious institutions around the world. \
\
She received the first of her five Grammy Awards in 1989, and also won two Latin Grammy Awards. She received three doctorates Honoris Causa from Yale, Florida International University and Miami University. \

Celia Cruz began singing in amateur contests at the age of 14, in her home city of Havana, Cuba. She studied music theory, piano and voice at the National Music Conservatory. \
\
\
In 1950 she began singing with the conjunto La Sonora Matancera, and with that group she was a central figure in some of the most glorious chapters of Afro-Cuban music, recording a number of legendary songs, including \'Yembe Laroco\', \'Yerbero Moderno\', \'Burundanga\', and \'Caramelo\' by the end of the 1950\'s La Sonora Matancera was the most popular group in Cuba. Celia\'s alliance with them took her beyond the coast of Cuba and exported her talent to the world. While in the group she met Pedro Knight, at the time one of the band\'s two trumpeters. This relationship culminated in matrimony and lasted 42 years. \

American vocalist. First sang professionally in high school, then most strongly influenced by his idol Bing Crosby. In 1940, David took his first big step into his professional career with the Jack Teagarden Band. Entering the army, in 1942 he served with the First Division on its African campaign. Out of the army, he sang with the Van Alexander Orchestra. By now he had given up his Bing Crosby style, and was listening with interest to Sarah Vaughan, Dick Haymes, early Al Hibbler, Peggy Lee, and Frank Sinatra, but was developping his own style. David moved next to the early Henry Jerome band, with sidemen such as Al Cohn, Tiny Kahn, Harry Biss, Ollie Wilson, and most of all, Johnny Mandel. After the Jerome band broke up, David sang at WHN and WNEW radio and spent a short stint with the Bob Chester band, before joining Mandel in the new experimental Boyd Raeburn Band.\

\
\
American songwriter, arranger, producer, trumpet player, and A&R man.\
\
\
[b]Glover[/b]\'s career began as a young trumpet player through high school and college before he joined [a=Buddy Johnson]\'s big band in early 1944 on [l=Decca]. It was with [a=Lucky Millinder]\'s orchestra, as both a musician and arranger in early 1945, that [b]Glover[/b] met [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/King+Records+(3)]King Records[/url] founder [a=Syd Nathan], who hired him as an A&R man. The label became an early pioneer in the cultural and racial integration of American music, from blues and R&B to rockabilly, bluegrass, western swing, and country. \
\
\
[b]Glover[/b]  co-wrote \'Blues Stay Away from Me\' with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Delmore+Brothers,+The]The Delmore Brothers[/url], covered by [a=Bob Dylan], and became one of the first black producers of country music with his input on \'The Hucklebuck\' by [l=Rama]\'s [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Paul+Williams+(9)]Paul Williams[/url].  A 1948 [b]Glover[/b] instrumental became the theme tune \'Moondog\', used by DJ [a=Alan Freed]. At King [b]Glover[/b] had a run of recordings on its independent Queen Records label before it merged with King at 1540 Brewster Avenue, where [b]Glover[/b] then began a series of successful blues fusion/R&B signings and recordings, later moving on to create Jay & Cee Music publishing and to control King\'s New York operations.\
\
\
It was in New York that [b]Glover[/b] departed King to join [a=Morris Levy]\'s [l=Roulette Records] label in 1958, helping revive the [l=Gee] label and introduce R&B to Roulette with the likes of [a=Sarah Vaughan] and [a=Ronnie Hawkins]. He helped [a=The Hawks (2)] produce singles as a new Canadian group, which evolved into [a=The Band]. In 1961 [b]Glover[/b] had a co-writing hit with \'Peppermint Twist\' and for a period in the early 1960s [b]Glover[/b] managed his own label, \'[b]Glover[/b]\', recording [a=Louisiana Red] and [a=Titus Turner] among others. Back with King, after Nathan\'s death in 1968, [b]Glover[/b] ran the company- now much reliant on [a=James Brown]\'s work- until its takeover by [l=Starday Records].\
\
\
[b]Glover[/b] then founded RCO Productions with [a=Levon Helm] in 1975, whilst also producing the Grammy-winning [a=Muddy Waters] Woodstock album and helping arrange [url=http://www.discogs.com/Band-The-Last-Waltz/master/14495]The Last Waltz[/url]. Before his death in 1991 [b]Glover[/b] was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He died of a heart attack, survived by his wife Doris, son Ware and daughter Syracuse.\

\
Hammond virtuoso and electric-bass player, Kynard didn\'t become too famous for two reasons: he just played in his local L.A. instead of touring, and he recorded very few sessions. Nevertheless, his artistry was enormous and his recordings are true gems.\
\
\
He was too busy to devote himself to a successful career as a jazz musician. During the day he worked with mentally retarded children, at night he played at local clubs and on sunday he played organ at his church. Even so, he had time for his wife and children.\
\
\
Kynard was a master at different styles. Playing funk he could have rivalled Richard \'Groove\' Holmes in speed and accuracy; his blues were delightful and when it came to slow down he knew how to add an airy touch letting the others play.\
\
\
His recordings were scarce but he shared studio with top notch artists like Les McCann, Houston Person, Grant Green and Idris Muhammad.\

'Mary Lou Williams':\
'real name: Mary Elfreda Winn--Born: 8 May 1910, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\
\
Died: 28 May 1981, Durham, North Carolina, USA\
\
\
Black American jazz pianist, composer and arranger who performed with almost every major jazz artist throughout her career and renowned for her approach to the \'bop\' style.\
\
\
Williams grew up in a \'shotgun shack\', where local musicians would gather and play. She played piano by ear from a very early age, so small she sat on musician\'s laps to reach the keys. By the time she and her elder sister Mamie had moved to Pittsburgh she had a stepfather, professional gambler Fletcher Burley. He would take her into gambling joints, where she would play and get tips, whilst her boogie piano skills also came in useful at rent-parties and chitterlin\' struts.\
\
\
Still in her pre-teens she was impressed by the likes of female pianists [a634888] and [a307316] and the works of [a257353], [a309976] and, especially, Jack Howard. Even at this age she was \'toughening up\' to the realities of performing live ghetto music between East Liberty, Soho and the downtown districts of Pittsburgh.\
\
\
By the time Williams was in high school she had her big break. Her mother agreed, with the Theatre Owners\' Booking Association [TOBA], for her to tour with the \'Hits & Bits\' show for two months. Williams later referred to the acronym as \'Tough On Black Artists\'. It was a tour that enabled Williams to meet Earl Hines, [a1802929], [a309984], [a38201] and the blues singer, [a634503], in Chicago.\
\
\
In Cleveland she met [a731706] with his Syncopaters. \'Bearcat\', as he was known, impressed her and he would later become her husband. Back at school she began to learn more instruments, but decided to stick to the piano. After graduation she joined up with Williams on another TOBA tour and finally ended up in New York. Here she met [a253482] and got an intermission residence at Connie\'s Inn. Williams then went and got married in Memphis, where the two set up a new band, playing out of the Pink Rose Ballroom. Her husband then went to Oklahoma on an engagement, leaving seventeen year-old Mary Lou as leader of the band. She then joined up with her husband in Oklahoma, in the band that would become [a335595].\
\
\
Williams\' career then took another turn in Kansas City, playing all the speak-easy clubs during the prohibition years. In 1930 Williams cut her first solo recordings \'Drag \'Em\' and \'Night Life\' - for which she later barred sales, as she was never paid, although the producer had at least given her the new credit, by which she became known, \'Mary Lou\'. She then played with Kirk\'s band at the Pearl Theater in Philadelphia, backing [a888440]\'s act, followed by stints at Winnwood Beach Park Ballroom, the Sunset and Fairyland Park Ballroom in Kansas City. In Kansas she was also influenced by meeting [a265634], [a251783], [a145256] and female pianists [a317861], Oceola and \'Countess\' [a326846]. [a313012]\'s hot vocals were added to the band and [a257115] quit to join [a253474], around the same time that [a145262] was gaining attention at Kansas City\'s Reno Club. In this fertile atmosphere of swing Williams was composing and arranging furiously, penning numbers such as \'Froggy Bottom\', \'Steppin\' Pretty\', \'Corky\', \'Walkin\' And Swingin\'\' and the popular \'Cloudy\'.\
\
\
In 1936 she recorded \'Isabelle\' and \'Overhand\' with Decca and was on nightly broadcasts from Cleveland, along with Pha Terrell and [a313076]. The band\'s release of \'Froggy Bottom\' became a big juke-hit and Williams toured with Kirk and the band through all the Southern states. By 1938 she had written vast quantities of arrangements for all the big names in jazz, sometimes credited, sometimes not. After a six-month engagement with yet another band line-up at the Grand Terrace in Chicago, that included [a843791] and [a322294], Williams was hospitalized with exhaustion and convalesced back in Pittsburgh. She rejoined the band for their residency at The Cotton Club in New York and, by the end of the club itself in 1941, her career took a down-turn. John Williams had departed her to start a catering business with Kirk\'s wife Mary, their musician Dick Wilson died and Mary Lou left the Andy Kirk band to return, once again, to Pittsburgh. Here she formed a combo with [a309982] that included [a29977] and Orlando Wright. However, Baker was soon poached by [a145257] and, by the time Williams\' band reached New York, she realised how much she missed him. She and Baker got hitched in Baltimore and so Williams\' piano occasionally became part of Ellington\'s ensemble. She left the band in Canada and went back to New York to join in the sessions at Minton\'s Playhouse on West 118th Street - the \'house that built bop\'. Here she jammed with Monk and the likes of [a312997], [a228917] and [a264620] until 1943, when an offer came to play solo in shows at the Café Society. Through this period of \'the bop\' she interpolated ideas with friends like Thelonius Monk, Tadd Dameron, [a258464], [a254945], [a29992] and Aaron Bridges. \
\
\
Williams had firm ideas about \'the real bop\' as she explained in \'Melody Maker\' in 1954; \'Often you hear guys blowing a lot of notes and people say: `They\'re bopping.\' But they are not. Bop is the phrasing and accenting of the notes, as well as the harmonies used. Every other note is accented. Never in the history of jazz has the phrasing been like it is in bop. Musicians like [a37737] come up with different styles which may be interesting. But they are not bop... That\'s one reason I tried to encourage the original modernists to continue writing and experimenting... Jazz is created in the mind, felt in the heart and heard through the fingertips\'.\
\
\
During 1944 Williams took time out and was recorded by \'Moe\' [a688836], who gained her royalty rights for works and also captured her \'Zodiac Suite\', helping her to gain the recognition and financial freedom she deserved. She also met up with David Stone Martin and photographer Gjon Mili, the former designing her sleeves and the latter eventually displaying her portraits in New York\'s Museum Of Modern Art. \
\
\
After playing in both Café Society and Uptown Café on 59th Street for some five years her next break came when [a166628] hit town. Granz gained her recording dates with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, where her re-arranged \'Zodiac\' works were again captured to acetate. Williams then took time out again and then picked up, after doing some broadcasts and TV shows, to join [a254768] at Bop City on Broadway. In 1952 she then performed in the UK and toured Europe. Williams gave back much of what she had learned in her career, giving jazz masterclasses in American schools and on campus in her later years. Her final recording, three years before her death from bladder cancer, was \'Solo Recital\' - a medley of spirituals, ragtime, blues and swing - recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1978. She was interred at Calvary Cemetery in her hometown of Pittsburgh.  \

\
\
John Coltrane was one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century. His early recordings capture a musician in the relatively conventional confines of bebop and hardbop, but his enduring legacy primarily rests on the modal jazz pioneered by his classic quartet (1960-64) and by free jazz explorations late in his career.\
\
\
He recorded more than fifty albums as a leader and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, performing with other giants of jazz like [a=Miles Davis] and [a=Thelonious Monk]. Coltrane received numerous awards including a posthumous \'Special Citation\' from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2007 for his \'masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz\'.\
\
\
As his life progressed, his music and outlook became increasingly spiritual. After his death he was proclaimed as a saint by the African Orthodox church that took his name.\

In May 1942, he joined [a=Charlie Ventura]\'s Orchestra, only to be lured away that same October by [a=Gene Krupa]. When Krupa\'s orchestra was disbanded in early 1943, Walters recorded with [a=Billie Holiday]. In late 1943, Walters briefly joined Tommy Dorsey\'s orchestra. When Tommy realized he could sing as well and sounded very much like Frank Sinatra, he featured him as a male vocalist, causing a sensation. Tommy offered Walters a five-year contract but insisted on a cut of all future earnings should Walters decide to go solo. Instead, Walters made a few more small combo recordings with [a=Sonny Greer] and [a=Cozy Cole], then joined [a=Jimmy Dorsey And His Orchestra] on guitar and vocals in June 1944, again to great public acclaim. In October 1945, he did enter on a solo career as a vocalist, signing first with [l=ARA], then with [l=Musicraft]. In April 1946, his recording of \'Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside)\' reached the Top Ten, but later efforts did not create much of a stir. By 1948, Walters\' career had faded and he returned to Philadelphia where he died a few years later of cirrhosis.',

\
[b]Kaye[/b] was one of a few female artists among the accomplished session musicians of the \'Wrecking Crew\' Collective. Her distinctive bass-playing talents were originally rooted in the jazz arena, with the likes of [a=Jack Sheldon], [a=Billy Higgins] and [a=Teddy Edwards], before she became a \'first call\' artist to Los Angeles studios. Especially for the [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Beach+Boys%2C+The]The Beach Boys\'[/url] [a=Brian Wilson], who said of her “Carol Kaye was the greatest bass player I’ve ever met”. [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Frank+Zappa]Zappa[/url] called upon her jazz skills for 12-string guitar work on [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/414197]Freak Out![/url], his choice no doubt influenced by her work on one of his favorite singles, [r=1295472] by [a=Tennessee Ernie Ford]. In sharp contrast she laid down tracks for [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/Monkees,+The]The Monkees[/url] hits and TV themes such as [url=http://www.discogs.com/release/1063063]Mannix and Mission: Impossible[/url].\
\
\
With more than 10,000 sessions to her credit [b]Kaye[/b] has helped launch many an artist with her gifted work, in studios such as Gold Star Recording Studios, Western Recorders, Radio Recorders, CBS Studios and RCA Victor Studios where the Wrecking Crew helped to furnish the hits from California. [b]Kaye[/b] really was one of the \'California Girls\'. She has also produced a wealth of tutorial books and multimedia on the art of playing the bass and retired during the 1970s because of arthritis.\
\
\
Occasionally, members of the Crew would come together and release works in their own right. In this respect [b]Kaye[/b] featured in the groups [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Zodiac,+The]The Zodiac[/url], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/California+Dreamers,+The]The California Dreamers[/url] and [a=Carol Kaye & The Greasy Bass Blues Band].\

'George Barnes':\
'real name: George Barnes--American swing jazz guitarist, born July 17, 1921 - South Chicago Heights, Illinois, USA - died September 5, 1977 - Concord, California, USA.\
\
He started his professional career at the age of 12, when he received his musicians\' union card, and toured throughout the Midwest. By the time he was 14, he was accompanying blues vocalists such as Big Bill Broonzy and Blind John Davis. On March 1, 1938, he recorded \'Sweetheart Land\' and \'It\'s a Lowdown Dirty Shame\' with Broonzy, the first commercial recordings of an electric guitar. Later in 1938, he was hired as a staff musician for the NBC orchestra, and became a featured performer on the radio shows National Barn Dance and Plantation Party.\
\
\
In 1940, Barnes released his first recording under his own name on Okeh Records, \'I\'m Forever Blowing Bubbles\' backed with \'I Can\'t Believe That You\'re In Love With Me\'.\
\
Barnes was drafted into the Army in 1942. Immediately after his discharge in 1946, Barnes formed The George Barnes Octet. \
\
He and his wife, Evelyn Lorraine Triplett, married in Chicago on January 17, 1947.\
\
In 1951, Barnes was signed to Decca Records by Milt Gabler and moved from Chicago to New York City. In 1953, he joined the orchestra for the television show, Your Hit Parade. The band was conducted by Raymond Scott and Barnes was a featured soloist. Barnes, Scott, and vocalist Dorothy Collins (Scott\'s wife) also recorded together.\
\
In addition to being a well-known jazz musician, Barnes also made a living as a New York studio musician, and played on hundreds of albums and jingles from the early 1950s through the late 1960s. Barnes was primarily a swing jazz guitarist, but could play in any style, as evidenced by his work on The Jodimars [2] Barnes participated in hundreds of pop, rock and R&B recording sessions: he was a regular guitar player on most of The Coasters\' hit records produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, he provided the guitar solo for the Connie Francis hit \'Lipstick on Your Collar (song),\' and he can be heard on The Drifters\' version of \'This Magic Moment\' and Jackie Wilson\'s \'Lonely Teardrops\'.\
\
\
Barnes recorded three albums for Mercury Records. The latter two recordings contained Barnes\' unique orchestrations with 10 guitars, also known as his \'guitar choir,\' which utilized the guitars as a horn section. They were two in a series of Mercury albums that used an early 1960\'s state-of-the-art recording technique known as \'Perfect Presence Sound.\'\
\
His albums with his guitar duo partner Carl Kress received national acclaim in the early 1960s.\
\
After the 1965 death of Kress, Barnes formed another guitar duo with Bucky Pizzarelli. Their partnership lasted from 1969-1972, and they recorded two albums.\
\
In 1973, Barnes created a partnership with cornetist Ruby Braff.\
\
From 1973 until 1977, Barnes recorded several well-received albums for Concord Jazz under his own name, as well as with the quartet he had formed with Braff.\
\
Barnes and his wife, Evelyn, had left New York City after his last European tour in 1975 to live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area. Barnes died of a heart attack in Concord, California in 1977, at the age of 56.\
\
\
Barnes\' style took shape before the development of bebop, and he remained a swing stylist throughout his career. His lines were usually short, very melodic, bluesy and \'inside\' (i.e. diatonic) as compared to the chromaticism and long lines of bop era guitarists. His improvisations often employed call and response phrases, and his tone was clearer, cleaner and brighter than many other jazz guitarists (such as Joe Pass or Jim Hall) and reflected his \'happy\' approach to music.\
\
Not long before his death, he recorded three live albums -- two produced from a concert at San Francisco club Bimbo\'s 365, the other at The Willows Theatre in Concord, California. The albums are good examples of his swinging, happy and often mischievous style. The albums also include his banter with the audience, and his introductions of tunes and his band, giving the listener a glimpse into his sense of humor.\
\
In 1942, Barnes wrote the first electric guitar method, The George Barnes Electric Guitar Method, published by Wm. J. Smith. In 1961, he wrote and recorded for Music Minus One, George Barnes\' Living Guitar Method; The Easy Way to Learn All the Chords and Rhythms and Ten Duets for Two Guitars (recorded with his partner Carl Kress). In 1965, he wrote How to Arrange for Solo Guitar, published by Peermusic. He also produced the first guitar course offered on cassette tape, The Great George Barnes Guitar Course, published in 1970 by Prentice Hall.\

'real name: James Price Johnson--Jazz pianist born February 1, 1894, New Brunswick, New Jersey, died November 17, 1955, Jamaica New York\
\
\
James P. Johnson was an important transitional figure between ragtime and jazz piano styles. His style became known as Stride. As a boy, Johnson studied Classical music and Ragtime. He started playing professionally in a sporting house, and then progressed to rent parties, bars and vaudeville. He eventually became known as the best piano player on the East Coast and was widely utilized as an accompanist on over 400 recordings and from 1916 on, produced hundreds of piano rolls under his own name. He backed up many of the Classic Blues singers of the 1920s, such as Ida Cox, Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith. \
\
Johnson\'s 1921 recording of Carolina Shout is considered to be the first recorded Jazz piano solo by some critics, although it sounds a lot like Ragtime to this listener\'s ears. He wrote several musical revues, including \'Running Wild\' and \'Plantation Days\' and his 1928 collaboration with his former piano student Fats Waller, \'Keep Shufflin\'\'. His song \'Charleston\' from \'Running Wild\' was one of the best known and most widely recorded songs of 1920s. \
\
Other hits included \'Old Fashioned Love\' and \'If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight)\'. Johnson composed several symphonic works, which include \'Yamecraw: A Negro Rhapsody\' (1928), \'Tone Poem\' (1930), \'Symphony Harlem \' (1932), a symphonic version of W.C. Handy\'s \'St. Louis Blues\' (1937), and the one-act opera \'De Organizer\' (1940), with lyrics by Langston Hughes. None of his symphonic works were very popular and have seldom been performed. Johnson is generally considered the \'Father of the Stride\' piano, and was a major influence on some of Jazz\'s great pianists such as Duke Ellington, Fats Waller and Thelonious Monk. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.',

Born: April 1, 1949 (Chicago, IL, USA)\

\
\
American poet, musician, and author known primarily for his late 1960s and early 1970s work as a spoken word soul performer and his collaborative work with musician Brian Jackson. His collaborative efforts with Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues and soul music, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. The music of these albums, most notably Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. Scott-Heron’s recording work is often associated with black militant activism and has received much critical acclaim for one of his most well-known compositions “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised”. On his influence, Allmusic wrote “Scott-Heron’s unique proto-rap style influenced a generation of hip-hop artists”.\

'real name: Edward Isaac Bickert--Edward Isaac Bickert, CM (born 29 November 1932 in Hochfeld, Manitoba, Canada; died February 28, 2019, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was a Canadian jazz guitarist. \
\
\
Bickert moved to Toronto in his early twenties and began to establish a reputation in the local performance and recording scenes. Jazz flutist and saxophonist Moe Koffman was an early employer, and Bickert appeared on Koffman\'s suprise hit single \'The Swingin\' Sheppard\' (1957) and a series of follow-up LPs over the next six years.\
\
\
Through the 1960s and 1970s, Bickert was frequently hired in Toronto as a studio guitarist for traditional pop singers, singer-songwriters, and easy listening albums. In the late 1960s, he joined trombonist Rob McConnell\'s Boss Brass big band, and continued to play and record with the group for three decades. Over the years, this group featured several musicians Bickert would work with in his own groups, including bassists Don Thompson and Steve Wallace, and drummers Jerry Fuller and Terry Clarke.\
\
\
At age 42, Bickert was hired by alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, and he played on Demond\'s final studio and live albums. Desmond\'s international audience of jazz fans and critics greatly increased Bickert\'s exposure and boosted his reputation. Following Desmond\'s death in 1977, Bickert continued to record and perform with well-known jazz stars including Milt Jackson, Ruby Braff, Oscar Peterson, Benny Carter, and Rosemary Clooney, Bickert also began recording under his own name starting in 1975, initially releasing albums on Canadian labels, and then signing with Concord Records in 1982. Between 1983 and 1990 Bickert released five albums under his own name on Concord, and appeared as a backing musician on several other Concord releases. Bickert also toured and recorded live albums with The Concord All-Stars, a group that included other Concord recording artists like Scott Hamilton, Warren Vache, Dave McKenna, and Ernestine Anderson. In the 1990s, Bickert recorded as a co-leader in two trios that featured his guitar with a bassist and one horn; the first was a trio with his longtime employer Rob McConnell, while the second was a group organized by saxophonist Mike Murley. Each trio released two albums (Bickert and McConnell also recorded a duo album in the mid-1980s, as well as a quintet album under McConnell\'s leadership in 1990).\
\
\
Bickert stopped playing guitar in 2000. He explained his decision to the Toronto Globe and Mail in 2012: \'I haven\'t played for 12 years, and I don\'t know if I could even remember how to hold the instrument right now [laughs]. I just packed it up completely. Maybe I\'d had enough … My wife passed away, and at the time, I was having some problems with arthritis, and I was starting to drink quite heavily, and those things combined sort of finished me off. I just never tried to get back to it. I envy or admire people who keep going until they drop. But it just wasn\'t for me.\'\
\
\
In 2012, Bickert was celebrated on his 80th birthday with a tribute concert in Toronto featuring many of the musicians he played with or influenced. Bickert died in 2019 in Toronto after a battle with cancer.',

\
\
Born : July 01, 1911 in Oakland, California.\
\
Died : February 24, 2004 in Salt Lake City, Utah. \
\
\
Alvino Rey is best known as the father of the pedal steel guitar. His inventive style helped popularize the amplified guitar for generations to come. \
\
\
Rey grew up in Oakland and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, at age ten. His first interest in music came when he received a banjo as a birthday gift. In 1927 he made his professional debut with Ev Jones and a year later signed with Phil Spitalny. He eventually switched to guitar and adopted the name Alvino Rey in 1929 while performing in New York City, where Latin music was the rage. He worked for Russ Morgan and Freddie Martin before joining Horace Heidt\'s outfit in 1935.\
\
\
With Heidt, Rey switched to the pedal steel guitar (which he later modified and called a console guitar) and quickly became popular for his unique sound. It was also with Heidt where Rey met his wife, King Sister Louise. They were married in 1937.\
\
\
In 1938 Heidt\'s orchestra landed a spot at the Biltmore Hotel in New York. Their new radio sponsor had signed them on the strength of Alyce King\'s vocals. Heidt was resentful and seized upon the first opportunity to fire her when one night her microphone fell off its stand and hit a patron. The other sisters immediately quit, followed by Rey, who took saxophonist Frank DeVol with him. They headed to Los Angeles, where Rey worked on forming his own band, which debuted in 1939 with the King Sisters as star vocalists. It was an immediate success and they began touring the country, eventually landing a job at the Biltmore, where they had been fired a year earlier and were quickly fired again when Rey played a jazz number instead of the society dance music favored by the house.\
\
\
The group found refuge in New Jersey at the Rustic Cabin, where they were broadcast over radio station WOR. Rey became famous for opening his act with an effect that sounded like a multitude of electrified voices, a gimmick whose technique he refused to reveal but involved Louise singing into a mic connected to his guitar. He was also well-known for playing Latin and Hawaiian music (two styles he later grew to hate).\
\
\
In 1941 Rey\'s group substituted for an ailing Dinah Shore at New York\'s Paramount Theater, which led to more exposure, and soon they were one of the most popular acts in the country, garnering top ten hits and making appearances in Hollywood films. In 1942 Rey reorganized his orchestra, bringing in an enormous brass section. The new lineup included such future stars as Ray Conniff, Neal Hefti, Billy May, Johnny Mandel, and Zoot Sims. Though considered one of the best bands of all time by critics, the musicians\' union recording ban of 1943 meant they were never able to record. Financial hardship caused by the strike forced Rey and his musicians to take night jobs at a war-plant before Rey officially dissolved the group in 1944 and enlisted in the Navy, where he formed a service band.\
\
\
After his discharge in late 1945 Rey formed a new orchestra, which produced a few hits before being disbanded in 1950. Rey toured with small combos throughout the rest of the decade. In the late 1950s he served as music director for the King Sisters as they made their comeback. He also worked on several exotica projects with such artists as Esquivel, George Cates, and the Surfmen. In 1965 ABC broadcast a special featuring the extended King Family. This special grew into a series which ran for five seasons, with Rey as musical director. Rey continued to perform well into his eighties. Alvino Rey passed away from pneumonia and congestive heart failure in 2004.\

\
One of the most popular jazz performers of his era.\
\
\
Thomas Wright Waller was the youngest of four children born to Adaline Locket Waller and the Reverend Edward Martin Waller. He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to the organ of his father\'s church four years later. At the age of fourteen he was playing the organ at Harlem\'s Lincoln Theater and within twelve months he had composed his first rag. Waller\'s first piano solos (\'Muscle Shoals Blues\' and \'Birmingham Blues\') were recorded on October 1922 in Race Records when he was 18 years old.\
\
\
He was the prize pupil, and later friend and colleague, of stride pianist James P. Johnson. Fats Waller was the son of a preacher and learned to play the organ in church with his mother. Overcoming opposition from his clergyman father, Waller became a professional pianist at 15, working in cabarets and theaters. In 1918 he won a talent contest playing Johnson\'s \'Carolina Shout\', a song he learned from watching a player piano play it.\
\
\
Waller contracted pneumonia and died on a cross country train trip near Kansas City, Missouri on December 15, 1943, after making a final recording session with an interracial group in Detroit that included white trumpeter Don Hirleman. He was on his way back to Hollywood for more film work, after the smash success of \'Stormy Weather\'. Coincidentally, as the train with the body of Waller stopped in Kansas City, so stopped a train with his dear friend Louis Armstrong on board.\
\
\
Thomas \'Fats\' Waller was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.',

'Samuel Blaser':\
'real name: Samuel Blaser--At a time when there are more musicians in the world trying to be heard than ever before, rare gems like Samuel Blaser seem, paradoxically, to rise above it all. With As the Sea, Blaser\'s follow-up to his 2011 Hatology debut Boundless and featuring the same multinational, transatlantic quartet - French guitarist Marc Ducret, Swiss bassist Bänz Oester and American drummer Gerald Cleaver - he\'s already achieved a rare prominence as one of his generation\'s most wildly elegant, relentlessly forward-thinking and undeniably virtuosic trombonists.\
\
\
Since his 2007 debut as a leader, 7th Heaven (Between the Lines), Blaser has grown at an almost incomprehensible rate, from straight-ahead hard bopper in his mid-twenties to innovative free player and ever-searching composer and bandleader in his early thirties, one whose improvisational strength has received praise from sources like  Audiophile Audition, citing Blaser\'s music as occupying \'ambient/free jazz terrain that has a depth of vision and clarity revealing musical maturity beyond Blaser\'s nearly three decades of life.\'\
\
\
Born and raised in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland - a lesser-known but no less significant jazz metropolis which was, for a time, home to expatriate Americans Sidney Bechet and Kenny Clarke, as well as Swiss jazz trombonist Raymond Droz - Blaser has also spent considerable time living in New York City and currently resides in Berlin; truly an international musician, then, in clear defiance of boundaries cultural, musical and stylistic. Beginning trombone lessons at the age of 9, he \'couldn\'t go past third position and had to have a trolley to carry trombone because it was too heavy,\' says Blaser. Still, with plenty of music in the Blaser household, where he was the middle of three children - ranging from Swiss folk music to American R&B and jazz - Blaser progressed quickly, entering the local conservatory at 14 and graduating seven years later in 2002 after receiving a number of awards in both the jazz and classical spheres, including the 2000 Benny Golson Prize. \
\
\
Continuing private studies, Blaser began a number of significant associations, including the heralded Vienna Art Orchestra and European Radio Big Band, leading to a Fullbright scholarship which enabled him to study in the United States at the Purchase College Conservatory of Music, going on to win the J.J. Johnson Prize, as well as both the Public Prize and Jury\'s Favorite Player awards at the 2006 Fribourg Jazz Festival.\
\
\
All of these diverse accomplishments have ultimately - and inevitably - led to Blaser finding a personal nexus where disparate elements like Indian Tihi and Wagnerian opera meet. Blaser\'s impressive improvisational élan is predicated on instrumental mastery that is nothing more than the means to very musical ends. Together with his equally unfettered quartet, Blaser continues to expand the purview of jazz, redefining it in the new millennium as it enters its second century of existence.\
\
\
Beyond Blaser\'s ability to combine knotty compositional form with incendiary improvisational prowess in the context of his own music, his unfettered yet ever-collaborative approach has resulted in a number of significant associations, amongst them his ongoing work with Swiss percussion legend Pierre Favre; a much-lauded duo with pianist Malcolm Braff; touring in 2012 as a member of François Houle\'s recent 5+1 group, and heard on the French Canadian clarinetist\'s Genera (Songlines, 2012); and recording/performing with Berlin-based Canadian saxophonist Peter van Huffel\'s HuffLiGNoN group with singer Sophie Tassignon. Blaser has also shared the stage with artists including trombonist David Taylor, and pianists Renee Rosnes and Hal Galper. It\'s no surprise that Rene Laanen of USA Trombone Online has called Blaser\' one of today´s finest trombonists.\'\
\
\
2013 will see Blaser touring with two new trios: one that, in addition to Marc Ducret, will also feature Danish drummer Peter Bruun; and another featuring French pianist Benôit Delbecq and American drummer Gerry Hemmingway. Equally important, Blaser will also reunite his Consort in Motion (Kind of Blue, 2011) Quartet with pianist Russ Lossing, bassist Drew Gress and Hemmingway, who replaces the sadly deceased Paul Motian.  That record - Blaser\'s first and only to include a pianist, marrying the seemingly disparate elements of Renaissance and Baroque period composition with more open-ended jazz improvisation - was praised by All About Jazz\'s Troy Collins as \' Fearlessly modern, yet respectfully regal.\' Collins continues, asserting that \'Blaser\'s adventurous arrangements and reinterpretations offer the best of both worlds, enriching the raw impetuousness of avant-garde jazz with the proven sophistication of ageless classical forms. Consort in Motion is a high-water mark in the enduring lineage of the Third Stream, and all the more inspiring for the focus of its vision.\'\
\
\
Meanwhile, with the release of As the Sea - like Boundless, a live recording but one culled from a single performance - Blaser reaps the rewards of greater trust and personal camaraderie built with Ducret, Oester and Cleaver through additional touring, following the release of their debut recording. \'The music is quite different from the first record,\' says Blaser, \'because things are more written. It\'s a little more complex rhythmically, too. But it\'s crazy, because I can play anything - a single note, even - and everybody will move with me. It\'s pretty intense.\'\
\
\
Between recording and touring with his own groups and collaborating in other leaders\' ensembles, Blaser\'s career continues an upward trajectory that seems to have no end in sight. \'The world of music fascinates me to no end, and I´m determined to take one journey after another with my instrument and work,\' says Blaser. \'It´s all about discovery and communicating new ideas. Believe me, I´m proof that a shiny trombone can send a message right to your heart and change your life.\'\

\
The trademark of Stewart\'s style was his ability to bow the bass (arco) and simultaneously hum or sing an octave higher. He was originally a violin player before switching to bass at the age of 20. \
\
While attending the Boston Conservatory, he heard Ray Perry singing along with his violin. This gave him the inspiration to follow suit with his bass. In 1937 Stewart teamed with [a=Slim Gaillard] to form the novelty jazz act [a=Slim And Slam]. The duo\'s biggest hit was \'Flat Foot Floogie (With A Floy Floy)\' in 1938. \
\
Stewart found regular session work throughout the 1940s with [a=Lester Young], [a=Fats Waller], [a=Coleman Hawkins], [a=Art Tatum], [a=Johnny Guarnieri], [a=Red Norvo], [a=Don Byas], the [a=Benny Goodman Sextet], and [a=Beryl Booker], among others. One of the most famous sessions he played on took place in 1945, when Stewart played with [a=Dizzy Gillespie]\'s group (which featured [a=Charlie Parker]). Out of those sessions came some of the classics of bebop such as \'Groovin\' High\' and \'Dizzy Atmosphere\'. \
\
Throughout the rest of his career, Stewart worked regularly and employed his unique and enjoyable bass-playing style. \

'Gerald Cleaver':\
'real name: Gerald Cleaver--African-American jazz drummer from Detroit, Michigan, USA, born 4 May 1963.\
\
\
\
Gerald Cleaver is one of the New York jazz scene’s leading drummer/composers, who covers a wide range of stylistic ground. Having played with jazz masters Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris and Ray Bryant as well as the leading lights of the AACM, Roscoe Mitchell, Muhal Richard Abrams, Wadada Leo Smith and Henry Threadgill, he is a product of many traditions within creative music.\
\
\
Cleaver is best known for his associations with Roscoe Mitchell, Charles Gayle, Miroslav Vitous, Mario Pavone, William Parker, Michael Formanek, Joe Morris, Jeremy Pelt, Craig Taborn and Yaron Herman. He is also the leader of the bands Uncle June (a reflection on the personal and familial challenges of Black Americans during The Great Migration featuring TonyMalaby, Andrew Bishop, Mat Maneri, Craig Taborn and Drew Gress), Violet Hour (a tribute to Detroit featuring Jeremy Pelt, JD Allen, Andrew Bishop, Ben Waltzer and Chris Lightcap), Black Host (a noisy avant-garde group featuring Pascal Niggenkemper, Cooper-Moore, Darius Jones and Brandon Seabrook) and Farmers By Nature (a free-improvising collective co-led with bassist William Parker and pianist Craig Taborn).\
\
\
Born 1963 and raised in Detroit, Cleaver is a product of the city’s rich music tradition. Inspired by his father, drummer John Cleaver, Jr. (whom Uncle June is named after), he began playing the drums at an early age. He later played violin in grade school and trumpet in junior high & high school. As a teenager he gained invaluable experience playing with Detroit jazz masters Ali Muhammad Jackson, Lamont Hamilton, Earl Van Riper, and Pancho Hagood. While attending the University of Michigan as a music education major he was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Study Grant, to study with drummer Victor Lewis. He graduated in 1992 and began teaching in Detroit where he worked with Rodney Whitaker, Marcus Belgrave, Donald Walden, and with visiting musicians Hank Jones, Kenny Burrell, Frank Foster, Cecil Bridgewater, Eddie Harris, Howard Johnson, Diana Krall and Don Byron.\
\
\
In 1995 he accepted an appointment as assistant professor of Jazz Studies at the University of Michigan, and in 1998 also joined the jazz faculty at Michigan State University. He moved to New York in 2002 and has since focused exclusively on playing. Cleaver has played and recorded with a cornucopia of artists including Franck Amsallem, Tim Ries, Lotte Anker, Reggie Workman, Marilyn Crispell, Matt Shipp, Kevin Mahogany, Ralph Alessi, Jacky Terrasson, Jimmy Scott, Muhal Richard Abrams, Dave Douglas, Roy Nathanson, Tim Berne, Jeremy Pelt, Ellery Eskelin, Charles McPherson, David Torn, Terje Rypdal and Lou Reed.\
\
\
His 2001 recording Adjust (Fresh Sound New Talent) was nominated in the Best Debut Recording category by the Jazz Journalists Association. Gerald Cleaver\'s Detroit (Fresh Sound New Talent), is an homage to his hometown and to the late, great Detroit drummers Roy Brooks, Lawrence Williams, George Goldsmith and Richard \'Pistol\' Allen. His latest recording with Uncle June, Be It As I See It (Fresh Sound New Talent) represents Cleaver’s most personal statement with regard to his familial past and his experience as an Black American.\

'real name: Ernest Loring Nichols--Red Nichols (born May 8, 1905, Ogden, Utah, USA – died June 28, 1965, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA) was an American jazz cornettist, composer, and jazz bandleader.\
\
\
Jazz legend Red Nichols was perhaps one of the most prolific recording artists in history. In the 1920s alone the cornetist appeared on over 4,000 recordings, working with almost every important musician of his time. Though his style of playing was influenced by [a282067], Nichols was a better, more polished musician. His contribution to the early days of jazz cannot be overstated. Few artists can even come close to equaling his accomplishments.\
\
\
Nichols studied music under his father, a college music professor, and mastered a variety of instruments, though he favored the cornet. As a teen he attended the Culver Military Academy and played in its band before being dismissed. Returning home to Utah he worked in various pit orchestras, joining [a3609960] in 1922. Later that year he left Stillson for a Midwestern ensemble called the Syncopating Five, a seven-piece group which was later billed as the Royal Palms Orchestra, and toured across country with them.\
\
\
In 1923 Nichols settled in New York, where he met trombonist [a764782], who became a permanent fixture in Nichol\'s various groups. Nichols most famously recorded under the name [a317885], but the same group of musicians also recorded under many different pseudonyms, including the [a1348288], the Charleston Seven, the Arkansas Travelers, [a807449], [a=The Hottentots (3)], [a=The Tennessee Tooters], and [a=The Red Heads]. The list of top musicians who worked with Nichols is long. They include [a254768], [a299282], [a229639], [a77991], [a301372], [a261340], [a301357], [a269802], [a301370], and [a258689]. During the 1920\'s Nichols also led pit orchestras for two [a261293] Broadway shows, [i]Girl Crazy[/i] and [i]Strike Up the Band[/i], and played with a variety of other bandleaders, including [a299946], [a951061], Cass Hagan, [a1263865], [a4590747], [a925208], [a412673], and [a831739], as well as with the group the [a708256].\
\
\
In the 1930\'s Nichols formed his own big band, which appeared on both [a575586]\'s radio program and the Kellogg College Prom in addition to regular broadcasts from Cleveland\'s Golden Pheasant restaurant. Vocalists were Frances Stevens, [a1929471], and [a1929465]. Around 1940 Nichols took advantage of the swing craze and updated his sound, though he still featured a Dixieland base. The new band recorded for [l20955], with [a991517] and [a312971] providing vocals. The orchestra sounded promising when it debuted but soon floundered. By 1941 it featured an entirely new line-up, including a [a349517] sound-alike by the name of Penny Banks. After a few failed dates in Boston, Nichols gave up the band, selling it to [a1503689] in 1942.\
\
\
Nichols briefly found work as a member of the [a311060] before retiring to Hollywood, where he led several small groups throughout the rest of the 1940\'s and into the 1950\'s. The highly-fictional 1959 biographical film [i]The Five Pennies[/i], starring [a439536], brought renewed interest in his career and prompted Nichols to put together a new Five Pennies. \

One of the most prominent US entertainers of the inter-WW2 years, Colonna became famous for his role as [a=Bob Hope]\'s side kick in his popular radio shows of the 1940s, and for appearing in \'The Road To...\' films, again with Hope and [a=Bing Crosby].\
\
\
He was distinguished by his imposing frame, bug-eyes, huge moustache and nasal singing voice. His recordings are generally characterised by big band music with Colonna singing humourous songs in a deliberately grating and tuneless way for comic effect. One of his most notable releases was the 1954 [l=Decca (2)] release \'Music For Screaming\'.\
\
\
Starting his career as a trombinist in dance bands around Boston. He can be heard with Joe Herlihy\'s orchestra on discs recorded for [l=Edison Records] in the late 1920s. \
\
During the 1930s, Colonna played with the [l=CBS] house orchestra, the [a=Columbia Symphony Orchestra]. During this time he became notorious for clowning and practical jokes, which almost got him fired on more than one occasion. This brought him to the attention of veteran comedian [a=Fred Allen (2)], who gave Colonna periodic guest slots on his CBS show, and a decade later he joined the John Scott Trotter band on Bing Crosby\'s Kraft Music Hall, alongside other acts such as [a=Victor Borge (2)] and [a=Spike Jones].',

In 1956 when he learned that [a259082] had died in a car accident, Golson composed \'I Remember Clifford\' as a tribute. Golson has composed several jazz standards, such as \'Stablemates\', \'Killer Joe\', \'Whisper Not\', \'Along Came Betty\' and \'Are You Real?\', that have gone on to be performed and recorded by many musicians.\
\
\
From 1959 to 1962 Golson co-led the Jazztet with [a179055]. Golson then left jazz to concentrate on studio and orchestral work for 12 years.

John said: \'I had to learn all of my major, minor, whole tone and diminished scales, as well as all of my chord types (major triads, minor triads, dominant 7ths, minor 7ths, diminished 7ths and augmented 7ths). He also made me learn as many jazz and standard tunes as I could.\'\

He then became involved with the Monty Alexander Trio for 2 years (1975-77), Count Basie Orchestra for another 2 years (late 1977-79), and Amsterdam Philharmonic Orchestra in Holland for 5 years. Upon returning to Los Angeles, John wanted to try his hand at film scoring but became a studio bassist for 75-piece orchestras that played soundtrack music that was in John\'s opinion \'quite mediocre\'. He quit that scene.\

'Sal Cuevas':\
'real name: Salvador Cuevas--Bronx, NY born bassist, Salvador (Sal) Cuevas played with Latin outfit Tipica \'73.  They split due to economical factors but also for musical differences, with the disjunctive of remaining tipico or going progressive. Out of this Cuevas moved on to Los Kimbos.  Curiously, although the Kimbos forming crew (Orestes Vilato, Adalberto Santiago, Joe Manozzi  - trumpeter on Tipica, now shifting to piano - and Nelson Gonzalez) wanted to remain in the tipico sound of Tipica\'73\'s first two albums, for this new album they also shifted, although momentarily, to modern ground, as virtuoso bassist Sal Cuevas actually is playing a Fender bass for most of the album.  \
\
\
During the late 70\'s and early 80\'s Cuevas had a great berth with Willie Colón - one of the giants of modern salsa, a popular trombonist, and bandleader since the late 1960\'s. Sal played unusually far-forward -- his funk-inspired slapping giving a distinctive flavor to songs like Casanova, Juanito Alimaña, and Tiempo Pa\' Matar.  Since then, he has played with Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria and a Kip Hanrahan project putting music to the texts of Ishmael Reed in 1985.  \
\
\
Along with Ite Jerez, Cuevas featured in Tito Puente\'s band.  Most recently Cuevas appeared on albums by two quite different Latin greats - Gloria Estefan\'s Latin albums \'Abriendo Puertas\' and \'Alma Caribeña\', and in 1998 the legendary Celia Cruz\'s album.\

'Ray McKinley':\
'real name: Raymond McKinley--American jazz drummer, singer and big band leader, born June 18, 1910 in Fort Worth, Texas, died May 7, 1995 in Largo, Florida.    \
\
  The drumming of Ray McKinley was a driving force that contributed greatly to the success of Jimmy Dorsey before WW II and the Glenn Miller American Band Of The Allied Expeditionary Forces during the war. As part of the Will Bradley aggregation, which he co-led between his stints with Dorsey and Miller, his personable and humorous vocals were an added attraction.\
\
McKinley\'s first sides were recorded with Red Nichols for Brunswick in 1931. In 1932 McKinley again worked with Glenn Miller in the Smith Ballew band as well as in the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in 1934-1935. In May of 1934 he recorded four sides with a Benny Goodman small group.\
\
When the feuding Dorsey Brothers broke up in 1935, McKinley joined Jimmy Dorsey\'s new orchestra, where he remained until 1939.\
\
In 1939 Ray McKinley became a partner of trombonist Will Bradley, co-leading a band that recorded under Bradley\'s name. This band cut dozens of boogie woogie laden sides for Columbia between September of 1939 and January of 1942. Unfortunately there was friction between the two stars, and the two had a less than amicable split in 1942 as reported by Down Beat magazine.\
\
In 1942 McKinley formed his own short-lived band recording briefly for Capitol and then joined the Army. While in the service he joined Glenn Miller’s AEF band and while in Europe formed his own “Swing Shift” group, culled from the heart of Miller’s band. After Miller’s disappearance McKinley co-led Glenn Miller\'s American Band Of The Allied Expeditionary Forces briefly with Jerry Gray.\
\
Back in the U.S. Ray formed his own civilian band, recording for Majestic in 1946 and Victor 1947-1950.\
\
From 1950-1955 McKinley free-lanced, occasionally leading his own bands, and working as a TV singer in NYC.

He attended the University of Buffalo and first joined Mangione\'s band in 1968, but continued studying until he gained a degree from the Eastman School of Music in 1970. Niewood was with Mangione through 1976 and appeared on most of his famous records, adding a strong jazz flavor to the music; however, his solo career never achieved real success (he recorded two obscure albums, in 1976 and 1978, as a leader for A&M). Niewood had a post-bop quartet with Dave Samuels from 1976-1977, led the Sunday Morning Jazz Band in the early \'80s, and played with Joe Beck a few years later. But he mostly worked in the studios and freelanced in low-profile jobs until rejoining Mangione in the mid-\'90s when the flügelhornist began his comeback -- although Niewood\'s 2004 album Facets proved the saxophonist/flutist\'s strengths as a session leader in his own right during the 21st century. He played with Mangione up until February 12, 2009, when, tragically, Niewood and bandmate Coleman Mellett died in the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 en route from Newark to Buffalo, where they were scheduled to appear with Mangione and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra the following evening.',

He embodied many of the most important qualities associated with jazz: swing, harmonic sophistication, melodic invention, bluesy feel and humour. Interestingly, he appeared on a number of highly innovative albums. (His awkward solo, recorded on the extremely fast and harmonically complex title-track of Giant Steps, is an infamously rare instance of the usually unflappable pianist being caught off-guard.)\

After a few years playing in the “Chitlin circuit” of the 1930s and just after World War II, Jordan launched a revolutionary sound: it wasn’t Blues nor Jazz but the “Jump Blues” sound which evolved into Rhythm And Blues. His jumping shuffle rhythms were copied by many in the 1940s and Louis Jordan with the tightest bands around “The Tympany Five” came to inspire many artists who followed in the mid 1950s, to the 60s and 70s, from [a=Bill Haley And His Comets] to [a=James Brown] but also [a=Ray Charles] or [a=Branford Marsalis]. \

'Fred Jackson':\
'real name: Fred Jackson Jr.--Sax Player, Flautist 1 1 1929\
\
\
Fred Jackson was born in 1929, a Flautist and saxophonist, he only released one album and played on a handful of sessions for Blue Note before disappearing from the jazz scene in the mid-\'60s. He deserved a better fate. Although he wasn\'t a wildly original tenor saxophonist, he was a solid journeyman who found a successful common ground between hard bop and earthy soul-jazz on his jazz sessions. His R&B-inflected style worked well on uptempo ravers and slow blues alike, and he had a nice, robust tone. Despite his attributes, he quietly faded away from jazz in the mid-\'60s, after his lone album Hootin\' \'N Tootin\' failed to sell.\
\
\
Toward the end of the \'50s, he gained his experience playing with such popular artists as Paul Williams, Lil’ Green, Paul Gayton, Chuck Willis and also Lionel Hampton. He later was invited to join the supporting band for R&B vocalist Lloyd Price and frequently toured with Price.\
\
\
Jackson made his recording debut in 1961, playing on a B.B. King session. Shortly afterward, he cut his first jazz record, appearing in organist Baby Face Willette\'s band on the album Face to Face. Impressed by his performance on the record, Blue Note offered the saxophonist a chance to lead his own session and he accepted. Along with his bandmates -- guitarist Willie Jones, organist Earl Vandyke and drummer Wilbert Hogan -- into the studio on February 2, 1965 to record the album that became Hootin\' \'N Tootin\'. Two months later, he went back to Van Gelder Studios with his supporting trio and bassist Sam Jones to record his second album. That session was never released, either because Hootin\' \'N Tootin\' sold poorly or because, as Alfred Lion\'s notes claimed, that the record was too short for release. The sessions finally appeared in 1998, when they were added as bonus tracks to the CD reissue of Hootin\' \'N Tootin\'.\

'real name: Lloyd Michael Bergman--Lloyd Michael Bergman, known to his friends and colleagues as Lloyd Michels. Lloyd was born with asthma. At two-and-a-half, a severe asthma attack nearly killed him. His doctor ordered that he play the trumpet. This radically improved his lung health, and controlled his asthma. At age five, he began studying with John Fabrizio. At nine, he became a student of William Vacchiano, principal trumpet with the New York Philharmonic. (Later, Lloyd himself became a student associate with the Philharmonic.) At 11, he studied with master teacher Dr. Roy Stevens, a proponent of Bill Costello’s method. In 1961, Michels played on Si Zentner’s hit recording of “Up a Lazy River.”\
\
\
In 1965, he followed Bill Chase to Woody Herman’s band, where he played lead and became road manager. Returning to New York, he played lead in Clark Terry’s band. Clark nicknamed him “Karate Chops,” and introduced him to Thad Jones. (Thad then recommended him to Quincy Jones, who picked him to play lead on his Grammy-winning album “Walking In Space.”) Clark also recommended Lloyd to Duke Ellington, who hired him frequently over the years. This led to a lead trumpet role in the onstage band for the Broadway show “Sophisticated Ladies.” (Lloyd also played in the Broadway production of “Jesus Christ, Superstar” and the Off Broadway production of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road” at the Beacon Theatre.)\
\

d. San Francisco, California, February 15, 1981, by drug overdose.\
\
 Respected for his fluid guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago\'s blues legends even before he achieved his own fame, and was one of the primary influences on the mid-to-late 1960s revival of classic Chicago and other styles of blues music. In 2003 he was ranked at number 22 on Rolling Stone\'s \'100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\'.\
\
Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud but clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb.Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul—replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his effect on the blues genre, on helping to influence the revived production of the guitar, and on many other guitarists.\

\
\
[b]Eckstine[/b], the son of a Pittsburg chauffeur and seamstress, began his singing career in a church bazaar at the age of eleven. The family moved to Washington, where he ran errands at the Howard Theater for [a=Ethel Waters]- earning enough pocket money to enter a talent contest, which he won in 1932.\
\
\
He quit school and joined the Tommy Miles Band, learning the trumpet to support his vocals. Bandleader [a=Earl Hines] heard Eckstine at the De Lizza Club and added him to his band\'s line-up, with whom he recorded \'Skylark\' which outsold the [a=Glenn Miller] version. Eckstine\'s growing success enabled him to open his own club on New York\'s 52nd Street, which eventually closed due to crippling entertainment taxes. He then took to the road with his own historic band, helping pave the way for the bebop/modern jazz style movement with its musical arranger John Birks Gillespie.\
\
\
With Eckstine handling the vocals, along with [a=Sarah Vaughn], the line-up included trumpeters [a=Dizzy Gillespie], [a=Miles Davis], [a=Fats Navarro], [a=Kenny Dorham]; saxophonists [a=Gene Ammons], [a=Dexter Gordon], [a=Lucky Thompson], [a=Charlie Parker] and [a=Leo Parker]; drummer [a=Art Blakey]; bassist [a=Tommy Potter]; pianist John Malaclin and arrangers [a=Budd Johnson], [a=Tadd Dameron] and [a=Jerry Valentin]. In the three and a half years this band was together Eckstine made his mark as a sell-out concert singer, as well as starting fashion trends with his sharp-suited dress style that would hold him in good stead throughout his popular solo career.\

\
Born: November 28, 1932 in Rosario, Santa Fe Province, Argentina. \
\
Died: April 2, 2016 in New York, NY, USA.\
\
\
Barbieri rose to fame during the free jazz movement in the 1960s and his latin jazz recordings in the 1970s. Born to a family of musicians, Barbieri began playing music after hearing [a=Charlie Parker]\'s \'Now\'s the Time\'. He played the clarinet, then switched to the alto saxophone while teaming with pianist/bandleader [a=Lalo Schifrin] in the late 1950s. By the early 1960s, he played tenor saxophone alongside trumpeter [a=Don Cherry] while living in Rome. \
\
\
Influenced by [a=John Coltrane]\'s late recordings as well as those from saxophonists [a=Albert Ayler] and [a=Pharoah Sanders], Barbieri developed his trademark warm and gritty  sound. In the late 1960s he was fusing the native music from South America into his playing. His music score for Bernardo Bertolucci\'s film \'[m=68315]\' (1973) earned him a Grammy Award. \
\
\
By the late 1970s he was recording for A&M and moved his music towards jazz-pop with albums like \'Caliente!\' (featuring his best known song, a version of [a=Carlos Santana]\'s \'Europa\'). \
\
\
Though he continued to record and perform into the 1980s, the death of his wife Michelle led him to withdraw from the public. He returned to recording and performing in the late 1990s, playing music that would fall into the arena of smooth jazz. \
